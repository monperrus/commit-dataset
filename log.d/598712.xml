<D:comment>This commit merges into 10.3 codeline the 2 changes that went into trunk (595047 and 595803) for DERBY-3172. 

I had to modify the merged code for the 2 test files by adding code to start and stop network server in 
jdbcapi.DataSourceTest and jdbc4.DataSourceTest. 

In the trunk, these 2 functionalities of start and stop of network server are already available in the 
TestConfiguration.java. This functionalities were added into trunk as part of checkin 574053 for DERBY-2855. I 
could merge the changes that went into  TestConfiguration to introduce these 2 functionalities in 10.3 codeline 
but there is an outstanding jira issue about this functionality causing derbynet.jar dependency. The jira issue is 
DERBY-3151 "Reduce dependency on NetworkServerControl in TestConfiguration" Because of this, I opted to add start 
and stop network server functionality in jdbcapi.DataSourceTest and jdbc4.DataSourceTest. I have updated DERBY-3151 
requesting that once we reach a resolution, we should migrate the changes into 10.3 codeline too so that individual 
tests requiring start and stop network server do not have to write the code themselves, instead they can depend on 
the TestConfiguration.java or some other class to provide that functionality. Once that work is done, 
jdbcapi.DataSourceTest and jdbc4.DataSourceTest should be modified. I think in addition to these 2 tests,
OutBufferedStream.java and TestConnectionMethods.java also have start and stop network server code in 10.3 codeline.
