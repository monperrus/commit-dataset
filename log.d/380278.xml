<D:comment>DERBY-966 DERBY-1005 1) Change DRDAStatement to use the EngineConnection.prepareStatement() method that has a holdability parameter. This ensures prepares on a connection that was obtained from a XADataSource (or a ConnectionPoolDataSource) do not lose the holdability requested by the application.

2) Change the client's state of holdability to match the embedded in that a Connection's holdability is set to close cursors on commit when it has an active global XA transaction.

Patch addresses this issue completely.
