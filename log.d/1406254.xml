<D:comment>DERBY-5954 NPE in SELECT involving subselects and windows functions

Patch "derby-5954-with-test-2" makes the code only look for in-lined
window specification in simply contained select lists. Adds a new test
case to OLAPTest which would fail with an NPE before this patch,
cf. original JIRA problem.

Backported from trunk cleanly as svn merge -c 1406240 &lt;trunk repo&gt;.
