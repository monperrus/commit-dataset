This commit addresses two issues. 

First of all, it cleanups up reset method in BaseActivation which was doing more than just bringing the Activation back 
to pre-execution state. The method had to make itself aware of holdability and what
kind of resultset it was dealing with 
before closing or clearing the row of the resultset. The reason for this behavior 
is commit code path was relying on 
Activation.reset to do more than just bringing the activation to pre-execution state.
 I fixed this by moving this code 
from BaseActivation.reset to GenericLanguageConnectionContext.resetActivations.



Additionally, in the new code in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.resetActivations, I added the code to not close the

language result sets associated with activations that do not return rows even if activation may have holdability set to

false. This will ensure that a commit inside a java procedure will not inadvertantly close the resultset associated with

the java procedure call.

 Additionally, I copied some of the cleanup work(as shown below) from BaseActivation.reset into 
new code in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.resetActivations 
   a.clearHeapConglomerateController(); 
   if (!a.isSingleExecution()) 
      a.clearWarnings(); 

This code above was always getting executed at the time of commit before my commit and because of that, I decided to copy 
it in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.resetActivations. If anyone has any comments on this, please let me know.
