<D:comment>DERBY-4944 Embedded Derby does not start when derby.jar is dynamically uploaded / added to the classpath

Patch BDFF.diff which checks if SourceCode#getLocation is null before
trying to access it. It turns out that in certain cases the location
may be null.

Patch supplied by michi at groiss dot com.
