<D:comment>DERBY-2228 Ensure that the J2SE data value factory is not booted with J2ME/CDC/Foundation 1.1
which does include java.math.BigDecimal. The J2SE DVF also assumes that JDBC 2.0 is supported
in that it calls setBigDecimal and getBigDecimal methods. Check also that java.sql.Driver is
supported which indicates that JDBC 2.0 or higher is supported.
