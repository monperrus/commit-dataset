<D:comment>DERBY-4061:InputStream returned from Blob.getBinaryStream(long, long) terminates the stream by returning 0, should return -1.
Fixed bug where calling code would enter infinite loop because 0 was returned instead of -1 (EOF). The problem occurred because the actual number of bytes to read was calculated and the case where zero bytes remained wasn't handled properly.
