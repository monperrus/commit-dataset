<D:comment>DERBY-4211 derbyall/encryptionAll/storemats.fail:store/updatelocksJDBC30.sql' fails with unexpected locks

The problem was the timing of post commit cleanup of deleted rows.  If the
test beat the post commit thread then it would "see" the deleted rows and
need to lock them.  By waiting after the commit of the deleted rows the 
results should now be consistent in the rows seen after the commit of the
delete.

Before the fix it repro'd 3 out of 100 runs.  After the fix it passed 300 out
of 300 times, so assuming it is fixed.
