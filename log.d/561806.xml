<D:comment>In tracing the types of various nodes created by the failing query for DERBY-2937 I saw
that some nodes had types of CHAR(0) which makes no sense. These were NULL constant nodes
where no type attributes were being passed in. Change QueryTreeNode.getNullNode() to
have a DataTypeDescriptor as a parameter and set the type of the constant node to be that type. </D:comment>
