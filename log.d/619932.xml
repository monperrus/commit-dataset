<D:comment>DERBY-3288: Fix optimizer dependency tracking logic so that it
correctly enforces join order dependencies between Optimizables,
even when plan "short-circuiting" occurs.  This patch also fixes
a bug in FromVTI's referenced table map (which affects dependencies)
and does a slight refactoring of the "pull Optimizable" code for
the sake of clarity.  And finally, it adds an appropriate test
case to the existing lang/subqueryFlattening.sql test.

Port from trunk to 10.3.  The "svn merge" command failed due to
changes in FromVTI which were made in 10.4 (as part of DERBY-716)
but which were not ported back to 10.3.  So this is a commit of the
manually-merged patch 'd3288_10_3_merge.patch', as attached to
the Jira.
