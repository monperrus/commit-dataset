<D:comment>DERBY-2813 store/ClassLoaderBootTest fixture testBootingAnAlreadyBootedDatabase fails indicating derby booted a database that was already booted by another CLR if security manager is on

This patch just improves the assertion with security manager on to show that we are picking up the wrong class loader. It does not fix the issue.
