<D:comment>DERBY-3043: Schema does not exist error when table uses check constraint

In Derby, the CREATE SCHEMA statement is optional. When a table is created,
if the schema which contains it does not yet exist, the schema is
automatically created as well. If the CREATE TABLE statement contained a
CHECK constraint, the statement was being rejected with the error

   Schema 'XXX' does not exist

This error occurred during compilation and bind processing for the check
constraint, when the criteria used in the constraint were bound to the
table definition. At that point in query processing, the schema name for
the table had not yet been filled in, so the bind processing was searching
the DataDictionary for a schema which did not yet exist (the schema will
exist after the statement is executed, but we're still compiling the
statement at this point).

This change modifies the bind processing for the CHECK constraint so that
the FromBaseTable object used to bind the constraint has the schema name
fully filled in, ensuring that the bind processing will be able to
manipulate the table without encountering no-such-schema errors.
