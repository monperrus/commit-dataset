<D:comment>DERBY-3037

Merging change(606106) from trunk into 10.3.2.2 codeline (The derbyall and junit tests have run with no problems.)

The commit comments for 606106 were as follows

With this patch(Derby_3037_AlterTableConstantActionChanges_v1_diff.txt), I am removing the Language 
Resultset.finish from AlterTableConstantAction. In addition, like Dan mentioned, what's being created in this part 
of AlterTableConstantAction is a single use activation which should be closed when its language Resultset is closed.
In order to achieve that, I have added following code in NoRowsResultSetImpl.close to take care of the activation 
+ if (activation.isSingleExecution()) 
+ activation.close();
