<D:comment>Merging Revision: 559125 from main into 10.3 codeline. The commit comments were as follows.

DERBY-2966

We need to have context set up inside a moveToInsertRow code because that code tries to do DTD.getNull and getNull needs to find RuleBasedCollator which is found by relying on the context. Putting the context fixed the problem.
