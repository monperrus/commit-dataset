<D:comment>DERBY-2692: Client driver doesn't chain exceptions received from the server

This patch makes the client recreate the chain of exceptions sent by
the server instead of concatenating the messages.

Description of the changes:

* java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Sqlca.java:

  - added a message number parameter to the methods that retrieved
    mesage and SQL state

  - fixed SqlErrmc parsing (used the correct delimiter) and renamed
    sqlErrmcTokens_ to sqlErrmcMessages_ since the SqlErrmc was split
    into its separate messages, not its tokens

  - added a string array called sqlStates_, which keeps the SQL states
    for each message in the chain

* java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/SqlException.java

  - added a message number field to keep track of which message in the
    SQLCA to use

  - changed the constructor that takes an Sqlca argument so that it
    recursively builds the chain of exceptions when the Sqlca contains
    many messages

* java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/ExceptionFormatter.java

  - removed the printing of SqlErrmcTokens in printTrace(), because
    (a) that method was renamed, and (b) it contains the exact same
    information as SqlErrmc which is printed anyway

* java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/BaseJDBCTestCase.java

  - changed assertSQLState() so that it checks nested exceptions on
    the client the same way as on embedded

* java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/ProcedureInTriggerTest.java

  - enabled an assert that previously only worked on embedded
