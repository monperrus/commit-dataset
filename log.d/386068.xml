<D:comment>DERBY-992: A corner case bug and missing optimization in
ScrollInsensitiveResultSet

a) For a scrollable, insensitive result set (read-only) which is
   empty, ResultSet#afterLast should have no effect, but erroneously
   sets the internal variable afterLast to true, so that a subsequent
   call to ResultSet#isAfterLast will return 'true' in the embedded
   client. It does not happen on the client driver, because it seems
   to do some double book-keeping for this case.

b) In ScrollInsensitiveResultSet#getNextRowCore and #getAbsoluteRow,
   there are missing checks will cause unnecessary read (attempts)
   from underlying result set even if end has been seen already.
