<D:comment>DERBY-183: Allow unnamed parameters in CREATE FUNCTION

This patch was contributed by James F. Adams (derby@xemaps.com)

The lookahead in the grammar of my previous patches did not work for some
parameter types. I have reworked the lookahead to use syntactic lookahead
similar to that used elsewhere in the grammar. I have included an additional
test that would have failed with the previous patch. I have run the
lang/functions.sql and lang/procedure.java using the various frameworks
without error.
