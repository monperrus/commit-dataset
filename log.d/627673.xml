<D:comment>DERBY-3304 and DERBY-3414

This serves as a test case for both the jira entries above. 

Number of code changes for transaction ending time went in as part of DERBY-3304 and this 
new test will check those code changes for specific case of rollback inside a java procedure 
call. 

The test case is currently disabled for network server because the rollback inside the 
procedure is not closing all the resultsets and DERBY-3414 is to track this behavior of 
network server. Once DERBY-3414 is fixed, we should enable the test for network server.
