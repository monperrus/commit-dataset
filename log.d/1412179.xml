<D:comment>[ARIES-967] NPE in org.apache.aries.subsystem.core.internal.BundleEventHook.event() at server shutdown.

Updated the bundle event hook to handle the case where it receives an uninstalled event for a bundle that is not in its
internal data structure because the hook was not registered when the bundle was installed.

Also fixed another issue where region context bundles of subsystems that failed to install at certain points were not
being uninstalled.

Added some new tests highlighting unmanaged bundle behavior.</D:comment>
