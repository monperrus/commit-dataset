<D:comment>[ARIES-972] Subsystem install fails with NPE if no subsystem manifest is contained in an ESA

The specification does not require implementations to generate symbolic names, so the failure was intentional, although
a more informative exception could have been used. The specification does not prohibit implementations from generating
them, however. A symbolic name with the pattern org.apache.aries.subsystem.&lt;subsystem_id&gt; will now be automatically
generated as a last resort rather than failing the installation.

Added new tests.</D:comment>
