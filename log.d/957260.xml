<D:comment>DERBY-4679 Several left outer joins causes unstable query with incorrect results

Follow-up patch derby-4679-followup, which makes the original patch
safer by also matching the column name once a candidate result column
has been located using the table number and column number pair to
match an RC. This is to safe-guard against false matches, since
DERBY-4595 shows that the column number can be wrong in certain
situations.
