This test was incorrectly depending on the exact free page state subsequent
to a delete.  This state is very timing dependent on when the post commit
thread can run so should not be used in tests to be run across a wide range
of platforms/machines.  I just got rid of the select of the state after the
delete, and left the rest of the test case.
