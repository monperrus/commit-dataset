<D:comment>DERBY-6283 indexStat daemon processing tables over and over even when there are no changes in the tables in soft upgraded database.

backported change #1502319 from trunk to 10.10, some manual merging was 
required.

Changed system to always drop orphaned stats during update statistics call.

Without this change soft upgraded systems running on 10.8 or higher derby
software, that had an orphaned statistic would spin forever in the index
stat daemon due to the same problem fixed by DERBY-5680 for hard
upgraded databases.
