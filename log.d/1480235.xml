<D:comment>Updates:

* Added text_kr field type to schema.xml
* Fixed Solr factories to load field type text_kr in the example
* Updated javadoc so that it compiles cleanly (mostly removed illegal javadoc)
* Updated various build things related to include Korean in the Solr distribution
* Added placeholder stopwords file
* Added services for arirang

Korean analysis using field type text_kr seems to be doing the right thing out-of-the-box now, but some configuration options in the factories aren't working as of now.

There are several other things that needs polishing up, but we're making progress.
