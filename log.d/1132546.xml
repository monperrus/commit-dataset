<D:comment>DERBY-3870: Concurrent Inserts of rows with XML data results in an exception

Allow databases that contain triggers with XML operators to be
upgraded from a version without the fix for this issue to a fixed
version. It used to fail because it couldn't deserialize the old plan
for the trigger. Fix it by not trying to deserialize the plan before
invalidating it.
