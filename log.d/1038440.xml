<D:comment>DERBY-4741 Make Derby work reliably in the presence of thread interrupts

Patch derby-4741-b-04-nio, which adds container recovery to NIO
RAFContainer4.  The old test Derby151Test has been decommissioned, and
a new one, InterruptResilienceTest has been added. Currently it only
tests the basic recovery case in a two thread scenario. Should add
more tests. The debug flag "RAF4" can be used with sane builds to
observe recovery events.
