<D:comment>DERBY-4122: ClassCastException in SQLClob when running in soft upgrade mode (10.4.2.0 -&gt; 10.5.1.0).
Fixes incorrect positioning of the stream after investigating the stream header (this doesn't fix the ClassCastException). The positioning bug is also only
seen when processing streams with a pre 10.5 header, which may happen both in
soft upgrade and hard upgraded mode. It will not happen in a newly created
10.5 database.
