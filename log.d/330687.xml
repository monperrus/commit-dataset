<D:comment>DERBY-463: Fix ClobOutputStream to increment offset, following similar checkin earlier to fix BlobOutputStream.

Comment by the submitter:
The test blobSetBinaryStreams.java was only testing the write(byte[], int, int) method for blobs. I have extendedit so that it would use both write(byte[], int, int) and write(int) for both blobs and clobs. Since it was not a blob specific test, I have renamed it to lobStreams.java. 
- Similar problems as the one fixed in the previous patch (the offset was not being incremented) existed in write(int) (for clobs and blobs) and write(byte[], int, int) (for clobs). These problems have now been fixed. 
- I have run derbyall successfully, except for store/encryptionKey.sql that failed, but I don't think it was related to my patch.
