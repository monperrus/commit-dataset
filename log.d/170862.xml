<D:comment>Derby-214 Remove System.exit from NetworkServerControlImpl

Patch contributed by David Van Couvering
below are his comments
I relocated the execute method from NetworkServerImpl (previously called DB2jServerImpl) to NetworkServerControl.

I modified derbynet/testconnection.java so that it checks and makes sure the exit status matches what is expected (1 for error, 0 for no error).
