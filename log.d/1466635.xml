<D:comment>DERBY-6122 -  InterruptResilienceTest fails with: junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: Database shutdown expected:&lt;[08006]&gt; but was:&lt;[XBDA0]&gt;

backported change #1466225 from trunk to 10.10 branch.

The core problem that led to this assert was that an attempt by the
test to shutdown the database timed out with:
Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Login timeout exceeded.

The test had set a 10 second timeout assuming that was large enough such that
no timeout would be encountered, but failed a few times in public IBM lab
nightly regression runs.  Raising the number to 1000.
