<D:comment>committing patch from  tsuresh@Source-Zone.org

Patch to fix following two issues reported in Derby-32:
1)   Exclusive file lock on dbex.lck  is  getting released before the
database is shutdown, allowing  multiple jvm's to boot the same database
in parallel
2)  Exclusive file lock on dbex.lck  is not released even when database
is shutdown.
