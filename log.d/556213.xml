<D:comment>release work:
 - updated RELEASE-NOTES which now
   . excludes bugs introduced &amp; fixed in 10.3*
   . does not distinguish new features in categories 
   . contains a small list of critical open bugs
 - updated releaseSummary.xml and ReleaseNotesGenerator which helped identify
   any new 10.3.1.2 fixes
 - reintroduce a changes file, but this time an CHANGES.html file, created by 
   commenting out the exception strings in the ReleaseNotesGenerator, followed
   by manual removal of the headers, and Issues sections.
