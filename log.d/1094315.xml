<D:comment>DERBY-5192: Setting up network server for management tests hangs intermittently

Moved the waiting on the shutdown monitor in blockingStart() into a
while loop to ensure that it doesn't hang forever if the shutdown
signal comes before it's in the wait() call, and that it doesn't stop
waiting prematurely if it experiences a spurious wakeup.
