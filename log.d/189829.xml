<D:comment>Derby-314: improve Eclipse plugin network server process handling.

The fix changes the behaviour to the following:

1) Only one network server can be started per project.

2) Once a network server is started for a project it must be stopped before any
   of it's settings (port, host and derby.system.home) can be changed.

3) If a user tries to change these settings when the network server is running
   they will be notified that they cannot change them, and the text fields
   become uneditable.
