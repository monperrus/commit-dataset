<D:comment>DERBY-3527: The slave will not notice that a network cable is unplugged and will therefore reject failover/stopSlave commands
Checks if the network connection is up by sending a ping message from the slave to the master. 
The shipment of the message has to happen in a separate thread because TCP timeout for send message is 2 minutes, and not configurable. 
Also added a message reader thread on the master that currently accepts two kinds of messages: ping and ack
