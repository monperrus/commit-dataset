<D:comment>DERBY-4679 Several left outer joins causes unstable query with incorrect results

Patch derby-4679b, which solves the following problem:

When transitive closure generates new criteria into the query, it is
sometimes confused by situations where the same column name appears in
a result column list multiple times due to flattening of sub-queries.

Flattening requires remapping of (table, column) numbers in column
references. In cases where the same column name appears in a result
column list multiple times, this lead to remapping (reassigning) wrong
(table, column) numbers to column references in join predicates
transformed to where clauses as a result of the flattening.

See also DERBY-2526 and DERBY-3023 whose fixes which were partial
solutions to the problem of wrong column number remappings confusing
the transitive closure of search predicates performed by the
preprocessing step of the optimizer.
