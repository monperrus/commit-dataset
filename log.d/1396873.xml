<D:comment>Fixed a deadlock and some CT failures.

A deadlock existed between org.eclipse.osgi.internal.resolver.StateImpl.monitor and org.apache.aries.subsystem.core.Activator. It occurred when one thread was initializing the root subsystem, had a lock on the Activator, and needed a lock on the monitor as part of installing the region context bundle. Another thread was loading a class with dynamic imports, kicked off a resolution that grabbed the monitor lock, and ended up calling the SubsystemResolverHook which needed a lock on the Activator. The fix was to remove the need for the Activator lock in the SubsystemResolverHook.

Also fixed some CT failures caused by the org.apache.aries.subsystem.core.Location class. The location string can be anything so we must handle it rather than throwing an exception.</D:comment>
