<D:comment>DERBY-3303: Fix OrderByColumn.java to account for "pulled" GROUP BY columns
when a) checking to see if the user has specified a valid ORDER BY column,
and b) trying to resolve "pulled" ORDER BY columns to their underlying values.
Also, add some relevant test cases to the existing lang/orderby.sql test.

Port to 10.3 using "d3303_10_3_merge.patch" as attached to the Jira.  No
additional changes were necessary.
