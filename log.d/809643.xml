<D:comment>DERBY-4338 Network client raises error "executeQuery method can not be used for update" when sql is preceded by /* */ comments

This patch, derby-4338-d, fixes the seen bug, and also generalizes the
method used by the client driver to find the first significant
(non-comment) SQL statement identifier, i.e. a keyword. This is needed
by the client's statement classification logic. For certain input
strings the old method also gave wrong results, cf. the new test cases
added.
