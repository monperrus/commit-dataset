<D:comment>DERBY-3299 (incremental): Add several utility methods to
DDLSingleTableConstantAction.java that can be called by the various
ConstantAction subclasses to drop a constraint and/or a conglomerate
descriptor. In addition to performing the drop as before, these
utility methods also check to see if dropping the constraint or
index necessitates the "update" of a shared physical conglomerate.
If so, the new methods will take the necessary steps to create
create a new ("replacement") physical conglomerate that correctly
satisfies all remaining conglomerate descriptors--i.e. all of the
ones that were sharing the dropped physical conglomerate.

Note that a) Derby does not currently have logic to recognize when
a shared physical conglomerate needs to be updated (that's coming
in a subsequent patch), and b) there are currently no calls to the
new utility methods.  Thus this commit should not have any effect
on Derby yet (incremental development).
