<D:comment>DERBY-6131 select from view with "upper" and "in" list throws a ClassCastException 

Prior to this fix the following query on a view would throw a ClassCastException
    select name from myView where upper(name) in ('AA', 'BB');
This query got in code that was trying to "push" predicates down, and
that code is only currently build to push constants and column references.
In this case it was mistakenly trying to push down the "upper" call, and
when it tried to cast it as a column reference it got the error.  The fix
was to check the type of the node and not push in this case.
