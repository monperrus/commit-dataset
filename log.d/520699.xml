<D:comment>DERBY-1861: ASSERT when combining references and expressions in ORDER BY

Follow-on patch to ensure that SanityManager references are only generated
in SANE builds. A call to SanityManager.ThrowAssert was not enclosed in
a SanityManager.Debug test, and so was not being optimized out of
insane builds.
