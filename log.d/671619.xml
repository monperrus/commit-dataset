<D:comment>Backporting (revision 670778 from trunk) for DERBY-3718 into 10.4 codeline. The fix involved using type
name rather than it's Types.xxx value to construct the TypeId object. The reason for not using
Types.xxx is that for internal Derby types like REF, we do not associated correct Types.xxx with it,
instead we just use Types.OTHER for it. It is not enough to use Types.OTHER to find the correct
TypeId and that's why we will be using the name rather than Types.xxx to construct TypeId. More
information can be found in commit comments of revision 670778.
