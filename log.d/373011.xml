<D:comment>DERBY-885 Disable running with the security manager for useProcess=false
for j9 vms. Causes some unexpected execption that needs to be investigated
and halts test runs. This is a workaround that will cause dml160 to fail
with j9 vms, as it checks to see a security manager is installed.
Will be investigating, but this will allow derbyall runs to complete.
