<D:comment>SOLR-5552: Leader recovery process can select the wrong leader if all replicas for a shard are down and trying to recover as well as lose updates that should have been recovered.
SOLR-5569 A replica should not try and recover from a leader until it has published that it is ACTIVE.
SOLR-5568 A SolrCore cannot decide to be the leader just because the cluster state says no other SolrCore's are active.</D:comment>
