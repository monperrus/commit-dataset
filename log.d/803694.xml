updated test to wait longer if expected background tasks have not cleaned up
expected pages yet.  Fast machines should see no slowdown in the test.  Slower
machines will wait up to 100 seconds before reporting failure after checking
iteratively for result every 1 second.  Also enhanced printout to identify
which test is failing between the 2 possibilities.
