<D:comment>DERBY-4376: Simple select runs forever

A MultiProbeTableScanResultSet performes one index scan per distinct
element in the IN list. Changing the start and stop positions of the
underlying index scan, and moving to the next element in the IN list,
happens when the scan controller is reopened. However, the reopening
of the scan controller is controlled by TableScanResultSet, which
skips the reopening if the current start and stop positions are
guaranteed to make the scan return zero rows. Basically, if the
start/stop positions are initialized with NULLs, the scan is not
reopened, and we do not move to the next element of the IN list. We
therefore just keep on retrying at the same position in the IN list,
and the query execution is stuck forever.

This patch moves all the multi-probe logic out of TableScanResultSet
and into MultiProbeTableScanResultSet, and instead adds methods that
MPTSRS can override where different logic is needed. In short:

1) Initialization of the start/stop keys has been factored out of
TSRS.openCore()/TSRS.reopenCore() into a helper method
initStartAndStopKey().

2) MPTSRS overrides initStartAndStopKey() and updates the keys with
the actual probe value. This ensures that the keys now have the
correct values when TSRS.reopenCore() calls skipScan().

3) Methods in TSRS that take a probeValue argument have been removed,
since MPTSRS.initStartAndStopKey() now does all the work with
retrieving the probe value and updating the keys.

4) Since the next probe value is fetched earlier now
MPTSRS.reopenScanController() can no longer use the return value from
getNextProbeValue() to decide whether or not it should be a no-op (it
should be a no-op if the next probe value was null, which means that
the probe list has been exhausted). To ensure that we don't open scans
in those cases, set a flag in initStartAndStopKey() to indicate
whether or not the probe list was exhausted, and override skipScan()
to check that flag and return true if no new probe value was found.
