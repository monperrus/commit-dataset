<D:comment>DERBY-4442: Default value and identity in an INSERT result set evaluated too early

backporting change #885421 from trunk to 10.5 branch.

Always add a ProjectRestrictNode on top of the source result set for an
insert if the source columns are not ordered the same way as the target
columns, or if inserting into a subset of the columns, and the source is not
a table constructor. Then the adding of default values to the source result
column list happens on top of the original source result node, and not
inside that node. This means that the source result is produced before the
default values are added, and the generation of the defaults happens at the
correct time.

As a side-effect, these other issues are fixed:

DERBY-3 Identity column not filled consecutively with "insert ... select distinct"
DERBY-4433 Cannot insert from EXCEPT/INTERSECT when target table has more columns than the source

Much of the added code is actually old code revived from the Subversion
history. Before DERBY-1644, we used to put a ProjectRestrictNode on top of
the source result if it was a SetOperatorNode. The code that inserted the
ProjectRestrictNode was added back and changed to operate on ResultSetNode
instead of SetOperatorNode.
