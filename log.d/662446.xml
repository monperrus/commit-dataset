<D:comment>DERBY-48 A connection request that has a default schema that is being created by another transaction will fail to connect

Patch derby-48-7, which auto-creates the schema in a nested transaction if possible, thus
allowing early release of write locks used to auto-create the schema.

This has the side-effect of making auto-created schema persist even if
the user transaction that triggered it rolls back. Added a new test.
