<D:comment>DERBY-3431: DatabaseMetaData.getConnection returns the wrong connection when using connection pooling.
Introduced a logical database metadata object in the client driver. This object is tightly associated with the logical connection, instead of the underlying physical connection. It will only publish a reference to the logical connection.
Added regression tests. Note that one of the tests fails for embedded, which appers to have a similar bug to what the client driver had.
Patch file: derby-3431-3b-client_logical_metadata.diff
