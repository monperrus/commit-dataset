<D:comment>DERBY-4874 - Trigger does not recognize new size of VARCHAR column expanded with ALTER TABLE. It fails with ERROR 22001: A truncation error was encountered trying to shrink VARCHAR

Backporting from trunk into 10.7 codeline the synchronization code in SPSDescriptor for getter and setter methods for the field "text" (this code is already in trunk, 10.6, 10.5, 10.4 and 10.3). This checkin will bring all the codelines from 10.3 through trunk to have the same synchronization code
