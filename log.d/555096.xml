<D:comment>DERBY-2351: Certain ORDER BY clauses should be rejected as invalid

This change modifies the ORDER BY clause so that it rejects certain
queries as invalid: specifically, queries which:
a) specify the set quantifier DISTINCT,
b) and also contain an ORDER BY clause which refers to a column
or expression which is not in the query result.

The problem with such queries is that we are told to return only
a single instance of the DISTINCT columns, but since the ORDER BY
clause refers to columns which are not in the DISTINCT set, if there
should be multiple candidate rows from which we choose the DISTINCT
result, we don't know which of those rows to use for the ORDER BY
processing.

When the DISTINCT and ORDER BY clauses are in conflict, Derby should
reject the query. This change modifies Derby to do so.
