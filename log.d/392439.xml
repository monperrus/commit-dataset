<D:comment>DERBY-1187

Defragment pass was not being committed properly, so when rows at
front of table were being deleted and freeing pages the defragment
pass did not move the rows to the free pages.  Longer term the 
defragment pass should commit more often, see DERBY-1188.
Added extra test to OnlineCompressTest.java for this case.
