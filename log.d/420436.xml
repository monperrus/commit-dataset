<D:comment>DERBY-1393: PreparedStatement.setObject(int,Object,int) should throw
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException for unsupported types

Description of the patch:

  The new setObject() methods call checkForSupportedDataType() to
  check whether targetSqlType is supported.

  Added a new error message "The data type ''{0}'' is not supported."
  with SQL state 0A000 (which ensures that the exception is converted
  to SQLFeatureNotSupportedException). This error message is used when
  targetSqlType is not supported.

  Added more JDBC 4.0 constants (from java.sql.Types) to
  JDBC40Translation and created a test JDBC40TranslationTest which
  tests that the constants are correct (the values of the constants
  are hard coded, so we don't get the compile-time check as with
  JDBC{2,3}0Translation).

  New test case SetObjectUnsupportedTest which is run as part of
  PreparedStatementTest and CallableStatementTest in the jdbc40 suite.
