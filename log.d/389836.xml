<D:comment>DERBY-1143: derbynet/prepStmt.java fails with JCC 2.6

Patch contributed by Deepa Remesh

This patch reduces the number of batch elements in the test
derbynet/prepStmt.java so that it can run successfully with jcc2.6.

I checked with the JCC folks who told me that JCC2.6 driver supports
less than 32K batch elements. When I ran the test, I found that
maximum number supported is 32765. As mentioned by Bryan, any number
greater than 9000 will provoke the bug. So this number will still
allow us to test DERBY-428.
