<D:comment>Applied new structure of the gdata-server project.
All source and test-sources are located under the ./src/ folder.
Created GData Object Model (GOM) folder ./src/gom, Core-Folder ./src/core and ./src/hivemind
Sources and Tests now splitted into their "sub" projects.

Fixed compile error in GDataIndexWriter as IndexWriter has not commitTimeout setter anymore.
