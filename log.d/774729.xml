<D:comment>DERBY-4199: Write exceptions to file in the fail directory as they occur with JUnit tests.
Write exceptions being thrown during JUnit testing to file as soon as they
happen. The output file is called 'error-stacktrace.out' and is located under
the fail-directory. If the output file already exists, the new output is
appended.
Added a new method for opening a file in append mode (in a privileged block).
Patch file: derby-4199-1a-writeExceptionsToFile.diff
