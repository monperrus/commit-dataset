<D:comment>DERBY-1010 - setTransactionIsolation can cause ava.sql.SQLException: Invalid operation: statement closed in some contexts with xa

Client has a Statement object that it reuses to send SET CURRENT ISOLATION commands to the server.  Added a check to make sure this statement was not closed before trying to reuse it.

This change takes the checkDataSource test a bit further (DERBY-435) but there seem to be issues with isolation being set correctly with xa_join.  I will investigate that and file a Jira issue
