<D:comment>DERBY-3279: Add logic for execution-time sorting of IN list values
into DESCENDING order when required.  This is necessary when doing
IN-list "multi-probing" on some column C for which a DESC sort has
been eliminated (by the optimizer). In such a case the row values
will come back in the order in which they appear in the IN List,
which means the IN list values must themselves be sorted in the
correct (descending) order.
