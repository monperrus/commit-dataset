<D:comment>DERBY-1546: Derby JDBC 4.0 driver returns 3 for JDBC driver major version

Description of the changes:

  * EmbedDatabaseMetaData40 and NetDatabaseMetaData40 override
    getJDBCMajorVersion() and getJDBCMinorVersion().

  * jdbcapi/dbMetaDataJdbc30.java was modified to print "AS EXPECTED"
    instead of the returned value from the JDBC version methods (of
    course, it prints something else if the version is not as
    expected). This was done in order to avoid the need for separate
    jdk16 canons.

  * TestUtil.getJDBCMajorVersion() was updated to recognize JDBC major
    version &gt; 3.

  * Fixed a bug in build.xml in functionTests/util. TestUtil.java is
    incorrectly compiled with source and target level 1.4. It works
    correctly after an 'ant clobber' because some other 1.3 class
    depends on it and causes it to be compiled as part of another ant
    target, but if TestUtil.java is the only file that needs
    recompilation, jdk 1.4 is used.
