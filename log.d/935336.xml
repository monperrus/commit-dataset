<D:comment>DERBY-3650: internal multiple references from different rows to a single BLOB/CLOB stream leads to various errors when second reference used.

Clone DVDs during joins if their value is represented as a (store) stream.
Enable tests as part of the regression suite.

Origial patch contributed by Mike Matrigali (mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net),
reworked by Kristian Waagan (Kristian dot Waagan at Sun dot com).
