backporting fix (change #672834) from trunk to 10.4 branch.

Adding space check to case where we try to move row to a new page. I could
not come up with a repro for this case, but seems safer to check for space
than not. The case the code is trying to avoid is a free page that has been
reclaimed with a nextid that requires more space than the row on the source
page.
