<D:comment>DERBY-2488: Patch to ensure that JDBC 4 Pooled and XA connections are returned
from JDBC 3 DataSources if the app is running with Java SE 6.  In particular:

  1. Adds two methods, "getNewPooledConnection()" and "getNewXAConnection()",
     to the Driver30 class and makes those methods return JDBC 3 objects.

  2. Overides the two methods from #1 in Driver40 to return JDBC 4 objects.

  3. Changes the "createPooledConnection()" method and "createXAConnection()"
     methods in EmbeddedConnectionPoolDataSource and EmbeddedXADataSource
     (respectively) to call the new methods on the DriverXX object returned
     from the existing "findDriver()" method.

  4. Removes the now unused "createPooledConnection()" method from
     EmbedConnectionionPoolDataSource40, and removes "createXAConnection()"
     from EmbedXADataSource40.

  5. Changes ClientXADataSource, which had a problem similar to the Embedded
     data sources, to match the behavior of ClientConnectionPoolDataSource
     so that client now correctly returns JDBC 4 objects for Java SE 6 apps.

  6. Includes a new test, jdbc4/JDBC4FromJDBC3DataSourceTest, which verifies
     that JDBC 4 connections will be returned from JDBC 3 data sources if the
     JDK in use is JDK 1.6.
