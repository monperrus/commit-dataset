<D:comment>Backporting the changes for DERBY-4874 to 10.6 codeline. 
DERBY-4874 Trigger does not recognize new size of VARCHAR column expanded with ALTER TABLE. It fails with ERROR 22001: A truncation error was encountered trying to shrink VARCHAR 

Had to hand do these changes rather than a simple migration from trunk 
because the changes in trunk depended on DERBY-1482. DERBY-1482 can't be backported to 10.6 and earlier because it had required 
system level changes which can't be backported to pre-released Derby products.
