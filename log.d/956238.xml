<D:comment>DERBY-4698 Simple query with HAVING clause crashes with NullPointerException

Patch derby-4698-2. The case of column references in HAVING clauses
being wrong after JOIN flattening was initially solved by
DERBY-3880. That solution was partial in that it can sometimes happen
too late. 

This patch changes the fix-up of column references in a having clause
after join flattening to the same point in time as that of other
column references that need fix-up after the flattening (rcl, column
references in join predicates and group by clauses). Thus the fixup is
moved from the modifyaccesspath phase to the preprocess phase.

Merged from trunk with no adjustments needed as

svn merge -c 956234 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk
