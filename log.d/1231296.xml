<D:comment>DERBY-4631 Wrong join column returned by right outer join with NATURAL or USING and territory-based collation

Adding comments to some of the tests, stating that Derby is allowing incorrect behavior because of DERBY-4631. Once the jira is fixed, these tests should start failing and would need to be changed to show the correct behavior.
