<D:comment>DERBY-540 Do not prepend database name for classpath databases with leading slash.This causes
databases to be not found when in jar files on the database. Correct the lookup of resources
in the class path storage factory to not use the methods that prepend the current class name,
instead use methods from ClassLoader directly. The leading slash was incorrectly added to avoid
the automatic package prepending performed by Class.getResource.
Removed code that tried to optimise not using the thread context class loader, simply have a
fixed lookup for resources of thread context class loader followed by class loader for Derby/system classloader.
Add lang/dbjar.sql to test databases within a jar and within a jar on the classpath and class loading from such databases.
