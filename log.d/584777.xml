<D:comment>DERBY-3098: If allowed by transaction isolation level, release locks whenn [BC]lob.free() is called.

This changes the following files:
M      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedClob.java
Only initialize storeStream once.

M      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/OverflowInputStream.java
Do not lock for entire duration anymore, but until corresponding
BaseContainerHandle has been closed.  Also, make sure that locking
only happens once.

M      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbc4/BlobTest.java
Add tests to test locking of Blob after free() for different isolation
levels.  Also, moved code from setUp that is only relevant to one test
case to that specific test case.

M      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbc4/ClobTest.java
Add tests to test locking of Blob after free() for different isolation
levels.  Also, moved code from setUp that is only relevant to one test
case to that specific test case.

M      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/BlobClob4BlobTest.java
Test that locks on Blob/Clob are released when transaction commits.
