<D:comment>DERBY-811 Enabling SecurityManager for checkDriver test. This test was running into problems when run with Derby jar files in 
DerbyNetClient framework with SecurityManager. This is because required permissions were not granted to the jar in the policy file.
Fix for DERBY-1275 took care of those permissions and hence checkDriver test can now start running with SecurityManager.
