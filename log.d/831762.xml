<D:comment>DERBY-3376: Test case in GrantRevokeDDLTest commented out

This change adds some additional tests to GrantRevokeDDLTest.

The test cases were originally contributed by Yip Ng (yipng168 at gmail dot com)

The tests were originally written during buddy testing of Derby 10.2, and
were committed as part of DERBY-1736, but were commented out at the
time due to DERBY-1589. The test cases now pass, and so this change
enables the tests as part of GrantRevokeDDLTest.
