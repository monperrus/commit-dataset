<D:comment>DERBY-709, committing on behalf of Suresh Thalamati

-- Removed the requirement for read permission on "user.dir" for backup to
run under security manager. Absolute Path were used only to log into backup
history file. Changed it to log canonical paths only if it can be obtainer
,otherwise only relative paths are written to the backup history file.

-- Added a missing privileged blocks to the save service.properties file into 
the backup.

-- Added privileged blocks for test util file functions that are called
through SQL functions/procedures.

-- Enabled some of the tests which were not running under security manager
earlier because of this bug to run by default with security manager.

Backup tests that test backup with jar Operations still can not be run under 
security manager due to bug DERBY-537.
