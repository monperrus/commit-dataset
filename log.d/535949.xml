<D:comment>DERBY-2230 AssertFailure: ByteCode Conditional then/else stack mismatch
The compiler/bytecode generator code does not load classes to check relationships or any other information. This is making things difficult to fix this bug. Also, I think it is not worth to go this way for a simple check that too in a DEBUG block.

Check for non-matching return types of then and else blocks in Conditional statement is made during bindExpression call and 42X89 is thrown if false. Hence, During byte code generation, check for non-matching return types is not required. I believe the assert check was included just to make sure that the stacks are consistent. But, it seems they do not consider a valid case where the two return types can have different vmNames (StringValue, ConcatableDataValue) which are assignable.

I have created a patch that works around this problem by adding another check for vmTypes. One of the reasons I chose vmType is because I saw BCMethod making its casting decision based on vmType.
