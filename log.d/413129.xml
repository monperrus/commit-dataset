<D:comment>DERBY-1327 Identity column can be created with wrong and very large start with v
alue with "J2RE 1.5.0 IBM Windows 32 build pwi32dev-20060412 (SR2)" with JIT on

The fix for this issue would be to reduce the number of parameters required by the constructor to &lt;=10 in org.apache.derby.iapi.sql.dictionary.ColumnDescriptor class. While researching into this, I found that all the 3 constructors in the class have a parameter named autoinc and it is defined as a boolean. This parameter is always equal to (parameter named autoincInc != 0). In my patch (Derby1327WrongStartKeyPatch1CodelineTrunk.txt) which is attached to this JIRA, I have removed the autoinc parameter and inside the constructors, I use (parameter named autoincInc != 0) instead of relying on autoinc. This cleans up the constructor parameter passing for all the 3 constructors and also brings down the number of parameters to &lt;=10. The test program from the JIRA entry runs fine with this change and I have created a new test JitTest.java based on that test program. Hopefully this test can be a place holder for any future JIT issues. I also ran the test suites and there were no new failures.

I also removed the import of org.apache.derby.iapi.sql.dictionary.ColumnDescriptor from some classes which didn't really use ColumnDescriptor.
