<D:comment>DERBY-6011: Prefer unique index when accessing a small number of rows

If there is a choice between accessing a table with a unique index scan
that is guaranteed to return at most one row, and some other non-covering
index scan that might return multiple rows, adjust the cost of the other
scan so that it includes the cost of fetching at least one row from the
base table.

This change makes it more likely that the unique index is chosen if both
of the index scans are believed to return no more than one row on average.
The unique index is the safer choice since it is guaranteed to return at
most one row. The other index may in the worst case return many rows,
which requires more locking and increases the likelihood of deadlocks.</D:comment>
