<D:comment>DERBY-4631 Wrong join column returned by right outer join with NATURAL or USING and territory-based collation\

Adding a test case with following comments
  /**
   * Test USING clause and NATURAL JOIN for case insensitive and
   * 	case sensitive collations.
   * As per the SQL spec, "the join columns in a natural join or in a named 
   *    columns join should be added to the select list by coalescing the 
   *    column from the left table with the column from the right table. "
   * DERBY-4631 - Derby does not coalesce as suggested by SQL spec, instead
   * 	it picks up join column's value from the left table when working with 
   *    natural left outer join and it picks up the join column's value from 
   *    the right table when working with natural right outer join. This works
   *    ok with non-territory based databases. It works ok for natural left
   *    outer join for territory based database but depending on the data 
   *    value, it does not always work for natural right outer join in a 
   *    territory based database as shown in the test cases below.
   * @throws SQLException
