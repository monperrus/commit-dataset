<D:comment>DERBY-4741 Make Derby work reliably in the presence of thread interrupts

Patch derby-4741-raf-stresstest-4. This patch adds a new test fixture to
InterruptResilienceTest: multi-threaded read/write test under an interrupt
shower.  This exercises primarily the random access file recovery
(RAFContainer4#recoverContainerAfterInterrupt), but since the interrupt can
arrive at any time during query execution, higher levels of the embedded code
are also exposed (jdbc, language, store).

The new test case is InterruptResilienceTest#testRAFReadWriteMultipleThreads.

I also found I had to add Class.forName(&lt;driver&gt;) to
DriverManagerConnector#getConnectionByAttributes and a new public method
BasicJDBCTestCase#openDefaultConnection(TestConfiguration). The latter makes it
possible use the main thread's test configuration in the server threads (when
runnin the test in client-server mode), cf. "thisConfig" member in
InterruptResilienceTest.

The test now runs in its own database, with derby.system.durability=test for
speed.
