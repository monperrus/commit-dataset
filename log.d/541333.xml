<D:comment>DERBY-1816: ResultSet.getTime() on a SQL TIMESTAMP should retain millisecond
precision.  Patch does the following:

  1. Separates the timestamp parse logic in client/am/DateTime.java into a new
     method called "parseTimestampString()". The new method takes a timestamp
     string and a Calendar object, and sets the fields of the Calendar based on
     the fields that are parsed from the timestamp string.  The method also
     returns the parsed microseconds value since that cannot be set on a
     Calendar object (the precision of a Calendar is milliseconds).

  2. Modifies timestampBytesToTimestamp(...) to call the new method for
     parsing timestamps.

  3. Changes the timestampBytesToTime(...) method so that it now parses the
     full timestamp (via the new parseTimestampString() method) instead of
     just parsing the hours, minutes, and seconds. Then a java.sql.Time
     object is created from the Calendar object into which the timestamp
     string was parsed. This allows us to preserve the sub-second resolution
     that is parsed from the timestamp.

  4. Re-enables the relevant test case in lang/TimeHandlingTest.java so that
     it now runs in client mode.
