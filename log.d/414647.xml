<D:comment>DERBY-1392, committed patch submitted by Anders Morken

RAFContainer.java#writePage(...) will
attempt to retry a write if an IOException is thrown on the first attempt. 
However, the next attempt does not add container header data to the first page, nor does it encrypt the data if the database is encrypted as the wrong buffer
is used in the catch block.

I'd expect this bug to be case silent corruption of encrypted databases if the 
code path was actually exercised. The fact that this bug still lives and 
nobody has discovered it is possibly an indication of how uncommon this code 
path is. Since the comment in the code says nothing about exactly what 
platforms the workaround was intended for, I don't know if these platforms are
still supported for Derby.
