<D:comment>DERBY-5686: multiple intermittent errors in nightly tests during DriverMgrAuthenticationTest test. reason: An SQL data change is not permitted for a read-only connection, user or database.

Make assertDirectoryDeleted accept if the root directory disappears under it
even if it couldn't delete all the files inside. The prime example is when
db.lck is the only file that can't be deleted. The reason is that Derby hasn't
shut down before the deletion of the database directory starts. Depending on
timing, assertDirectoryDeleted may be able to delete all files (including the
root directory) except the lock file, and the lock file is deleted by Derby
itself.

This patch doesn't fix this JIRA issue, it's a general improvement to the
deletion logic only.
