<D:comment>DERBY-3443 With IBM 1.6 derbynet/testProperties fails with listing properties

For 10.3, testProperties is also an issue, since it has not been converted to 
JUnit. Added sed line.  Looked at porting conversion but decided against due to multiple checkins, conflicts and trunk dependencies.
