<D:comment>DERBY-3596: Creation of logical connections from a pooled connection causes resource leak on the server.
Exposed method 'resetFromPool' through EngineConnection.
The network server now detects when a client is requesting new logical connectio
ns. This triggers some special logic, where the physical connection on the serve
r side is kept and reset instead of being closed and opened again (this caused resources to leak earlier).
The special logic must *not* be triggered for XA connections, as the XA code is
already well-behaved.
