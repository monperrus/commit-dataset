<D:comment>DERBY-4987 BootLockTest can hang reading spawned process output

The test will now only attempt to get the error output if BootLockMinion has exited and also has a max timeout of ten minutes which won't slow down normal runs of the test but hopefully be long enough without risk of hanging again.
