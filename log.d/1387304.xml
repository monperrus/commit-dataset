<D:comment>ARIES-925: Fixed issue in org.apache.aries.subsystem.itests.util.BundleInfoImpl where JarFile objects were being created but not closed. This class is used during the generation of the repository.xml which consists of a large number of bundle files. I then realized the repository.xml generation itself is no longer needed for the itests. So I removed it altogether.

Also fixed a potential issue in org.apache.aries.subsystem.core.internal.BundleResourceInstaller where an input stream might be left open.

org.apache.aries.subsystem.core.internal.BundleResource was refactored as part of this work to make the code cleaner and easier to read.</D:comment>
