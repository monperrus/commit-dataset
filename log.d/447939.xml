backporting change 439702 from trunk to 10.1 codeline.

Bumping the time to wait for server to start in this test.  In my environment
this test is failing consistently (and bad error handling in the test then
causes this test to hang forever).  Bumping the timeout so far has made it
pass (I tried it 10 times), where before it failed 10 times.
