<D:comment>DERBY-2806: Added a position-aware stream that can be repositioned on request. This was needed to support multiplexed operations on Clob, specifically involving streams. The code is isolated to Clobs on top of a stream from store (read-only), with the exception of UTF8Reader which is also used for other Clobs (temporary, modifiable ones).
