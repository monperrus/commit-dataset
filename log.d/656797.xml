<D:comment>DERBY-3674

Inplace compress test in store/TransactionTable.sql started failing after the checkin for DERBY-1062.
Prior to the fix for DERBY-1062, an inplace compress request on VTI would return with no exception
although the code just ignored the compress request on VTI. After DERBY-1062 fix, Derby started
throwing exception. With the changes going through this commit, I am restoring the behavior to no-op
on inplace compress on VTI. I am doing this by making the check for VTI in SystemProcedure and returning
from it if it is a VTI. All the other inplace compress request get fulfilled through internal
generation of ALTER TABLE sql.
