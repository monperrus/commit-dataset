Fixed the combination of LENGTH operator and parameters so that the parameters take their collation from the context and not from the current
compilation schema. In fact, it appears that LENGTH operator is not allowed to take a parameter and user would get sql exception 42X36 if
LENGTH was used with a parameter. I have added a test case for that.
