<D:comment>DERBY-1024 Remove the XA constants in XAResource that were duplicates of standard
constants from XAException and XAResource. Removed the code that translated (incorrectly)
an XA return value from one constant to another (with the same value in most cases).
Thus fixing 1024 where the incorrect XA code was being thrown, this was because the
unneded conversion code was incomplete.
