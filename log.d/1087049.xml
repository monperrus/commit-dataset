<D:comment>DERBY-5121 Data corruption when executing an UPDATE trigger

With the earlier checkin for DERBY-5121, DERBY-1482 changes weren't completely backed out on trunk and 10.7. We have backed out 
the code for the triggers so that now triggers look for the columns in their actual column positions at execution time. But 
DERBY-1482 also made changes to UPDATE code to read only the colunms needed by it and the triggers that it is going to fire. 
We need to backout the changes to UPDATE code to make sure that it reads all the columns from the trigger table and not do 
selective column reading.

Also adding an upgrade case testing the behavior of UPDATE reading correct columns from the trigger table so that trigger 
finds the columns it needs.

derbyall and junit suite runs fine with these changes
