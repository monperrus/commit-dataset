<D:comment>ARIES-474 Force us to use 2.0.8 up to, but not including 2.1.0 of twitter4j. It appears 2.1.0 is not backward compatible with 2.0.8, whoever created the API doesn't know about semantic versioning. This probably became an issue because 2.1.0 was uploaded to the external repository the test uses.</D:comment>
