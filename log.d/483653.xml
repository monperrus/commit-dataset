<D:comment>DERBY-552 Fix fetching resources from an installed jar when the database itself is a jar file.
The old code did not handle the case when the length of the resource (jar) entry was unknown.
New code reads the resource from the JarInputStream into a local byte array and returns a
stream based upon that to the application. This also provides better isolation between
the application and derby, denying user code the ability to read the entire jar or
to prevent correct shutdown of the database. Added utilities to AccessibleByteArrayOutputStream
to enable copying an InputStream into a local array.</D:comment>
