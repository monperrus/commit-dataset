<D:comment>DERBY-3279: Add logic for execution-time sorting of IN list values
into DESCENDING order when required.  This is necessary when doing
IN-list "multi-probing" on some column C for which a DESC sort has
been eliminated (by the optimizer). In such a case the row values
will come back in the order in which they appear in the IN List,
which means the IN list values must themselves be sorted in the
correct (descending) order.

Merge from 10.4 trunk to 10.3 branch:

 svn merge -r 616125:616126 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk
 svn merge -r 617547:617548 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk

This commit encapsulates the above merge commands plus a two-line
manual conflict resolution in JDBC.java; i.e. d3279_10_3_merge.patch
as attached to the Jira.
