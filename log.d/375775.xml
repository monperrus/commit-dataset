 Problem was backup was trying to a read a pages from a container before the first
 allocation page for it is created with a invalid page number. First allocation page
 number is invalid only when first page is not created.

 The reason backup sees containers in that state, backup finds the containers to
 backup by scanning through the seg0 list files and gets access to the container
 conglomerate cache, cache returns the handles after the container file is
 created.

 Fix is NOT to backup containers whose first allocation page not yet created. It is
 safe to not backup containers in such case instead of waiting for container
 creation to complete, redo of the log on restore will create them.

 Renabled the test case that hit this problem in OnlineBackupTest1.java , which was commented
 earlier.
