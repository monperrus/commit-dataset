<D:comment>DERBY-1759: XMLSERIALIZE doesn't follow spec when serializing sequence

This patch was contributed by Army Brown (qozinx@gmail.com)

The patch does the following:

  1. Adds logic to SqlXmlUtil.serializeToString() to perform the
     steps of "sequence normalization" as required by XML serialization
     rules. This includes throwing an error if the user attempts to
     explicitly serialize a sequence that contains one or more top-level
     attribute nodes.

  2. In order to ensure that the serialization error is only thrown
     when the user performs an explicit XMLSERIALIZE, I added a
     new field, "containsTopLevelAttr", to the XML class. This field
     indicates whether or not the XML value corresponds to a sequence
     with a top-level attribute node. If the user calls XMLSERIALIZE
     on an XMLDataValue for which containsTopLevelAttr is true,
     then we'll throw the serialization error 2200W as dictated by
     SQL/XML.

  3. Adds appropriate test cases to lang/xml_general.sql to verify
     the fix.

  4. Since Xalan doesn't provide a built-in way to retrieve a sequence
     of attribue values (as opposed to attribute nodes), I also included
     in lang/xml_general.sql a (rather ugly) way to accomplish that
     task within the serialization restrictions of SQL/XML.
