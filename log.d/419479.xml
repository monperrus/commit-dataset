<D:comment>DERBY-989: unit/daemonService.unit fails intermittently: 'ran out of time'

Two test fixes (in T_DaemonService.java)

  1) Clear the list of clients before each iteration of the test. This
     makes the failure be exposed earlier (10 minutes instead of one
     hour) because t_checkStatus() doesn't have to wait for
     unsubscribed clients to be serviced.

  2) Make the test accept that a client is serviced once after it has
     unsubscribed. This could happen if the client is being serviced
     when unsubscribe() is called.
