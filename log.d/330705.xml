<D:comment>DERBY-389 Fix nullSQLText.java for J2ME

 Attaching a patch for the test jdbcapi/nullSQLText.java. This test fails in J2ME because it uses a stored procedure with server-side JDBC. As I understand, the purpose of the test is only to test any stored procedure call. So I replaced the stored procedure in this test with a procedure in org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.util.ProcedureTest. Also changed the master files.

With this patch, I have run jdbcapi/nullSQLText.java in embedded, client and jcc frameworks. Also run this test in CDC/FP. This patch changes only tests. Please review/commit this patch.
