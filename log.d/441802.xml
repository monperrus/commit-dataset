<D:comment>DERBY-1817: Race condition in network server's thread pool

Instead of always putting new sessions in the run queue when there are
free threads, the network server now compares the number of free
threads and the size of the run queue. This is done to prevent the run
queue from growing to a size greater than the number of free
threads. Also, the server now synchronizes on runQueue until the
session has been added to the queue. This is to prevent two threads
from deciding that there are enough free threads and adding the
session to the run queue, when there in fact only were enough free
threads for one of them. With this patch, I am not able to reproduce
DERBY-1757 on platforms where the failure was easily reproduced
before.
