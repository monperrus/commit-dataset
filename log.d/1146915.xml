<D:comment>DERBY-5120 Row from SYSDEPENDS gets deleted when a table has update triggers defined on it and an upate is made to the table


This commit moves recording to trigger action sps's dependency on trigger table from create trigger constant action and alter
table constant action to SPSDescriptor. This central location in SPSDescriptor for recording the dependency will take care of 
create trigger, alter table and sps regeneration cases. The checkin also required fixing triggerGeneral.sql because now
that we do not loose the dependency between trigger action sps and trigger table, the change in trigger table always sends
an invalidation signal to it's triggers which causes those triggers to recompile when they fire next time. For triggerGeneral
case, the trigger in question ends up being incorrect(because of alter table add column) and thus would cause the test to fail.
I resolved it by fixing the trigger action.

Additionally, I have added upgrade test case which checks how the trigger invalidation signal are missed prior to this fix
thus not catching incorrect triggers. This test has been disabled for 10.5.1.1, 10.5.3.0, 10.6.1.0 and 10.6.2.1 because those
4 releases do not have DERBY-4835 fix in them. Because of that missing fix, the triggers donot get invalidated as part of
upgrade for those releases and hence the test added by this jira would fail for those 4 releases. To avoid the failure, I have
disabled the test for those 4 releases.
