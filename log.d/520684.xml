<D:comment>DERBY-2456 (export file stream was not closed when export fails due 
to an invalid codeset).

This patch closes file streams correctly, if any exception occurs 
while setting up the streams required to perform export. Re-enabled the test 
case in ImportExportTest.java that was disabled earlier due to this bug.
