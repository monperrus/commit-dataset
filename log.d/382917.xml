<D:comment>DERBY-618 Make the client driver connection URL work when spaces are in the URL.

Contributed by Deepa Remesh

 Attaching a patch 'derby-618-v2.diff' which includes code change and a test for this issue. Patch does the following:

* Modifies ClientDriver.java - removes the space separator in the call to nextToken in tokenizeDatabase method. This allows use of URL containing database name with spaces.

* Adds tests to jdbcapi/checkDriver.java for an url with spaces in database name. Since embedded and jcc driver work with spaces, I added this test for all three frameworks. Test verfies that the specified database gets created.

* Modifies master files for the test

Ran derbyall with Sun JDK 1.4.2 on Windows XP. I also ran jdbcapi/checkDriver.java with j9 vms.
