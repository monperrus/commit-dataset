<D:comment>DERBY-1610: Resolve difference of type compatibility between Embedded
and NetworkServer/NetworkDriver

Fixed failures in the JDBC 4.0 tests. Description of the patch:

  * Check for unsupported types before checking incompatibilities
    since JDBC 4.0 specifies that SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
    should be raised for certain types if they are unsupported.

  * Change timing of calls to checkForClosedStatement() to make
    ClosedObjectTest get the expected SQLState when the statement is
    closed.

  * Add type checking to the JDBC 4.0 length-less blob/clob overloads.

  * Since the type checking already checks for closed statement and
    invalid parameter index, remove those tests from
    checkSetterPreconditions(). Since the only code that is left in
    checkSetterPreconditions() after the removal of those checks is a
    call to checkForEscapedCallWithResult(), replace all calls to
    checkSetterPreconditions() with calls to
    checkForEscapedCallWithResult().
