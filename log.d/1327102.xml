<D:comment>DERBY-5608:BaseTestCase.readProcessOutput should read getInputStream() and getErrorStream() in separate threads
DERBY-5617: Improve process handling in SpawnedProcess

Backported fixes from trunk (revisions 1242681,1244444,1291631,1291647,1294592).
Had to manually fix the output generated by BaseTestCase.readProcessOutput,
since tags have been added in trunk. These tags, for instance "&lt;STDERR&gt;", 
caused some tests to fail on 10.8.
Another change introduced by the backport is that stderr is also appended to
the output.
