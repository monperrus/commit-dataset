<D:comment>DERBY-5574 encryption test in encryption nightly suite test fails with ERROR XBM0S: Unable to rename file error

merged svn #1236370 trunk to 10.8 branch.

Catch errors on rename, and retry hoping that error is caused by some
temporary file system resource issue.  Similar methodology that other
parts of the system uses on read and write errors.  Worst case system
retries 5 times and still throws the error, best case a subsequent retry
succeeds and user application is never aware an error was encountered.
