<D:comment>Migrating changes from trunk(revision 588527) into 10.3. These changes are for DERBY-3046. The commit comments
were as follows in the trunk(revision 588527).

This commit will ensure that setObject returns the same exception in both Network Server and Embedded WHEN the 
PreparedStatement has no parameters associated with it at all. Without the changes that are going in this commit,
following sql will return different exceptions in Embedded and Network Server (this test case is copied from 
derbynet.PrepareStatementTest). 

ps = prepareStatement("insert into WISH_LIST(WISH_ITEM) values ('bb')"); 
ps.setObject(1,"cc",java.sql.Types.VARCHAR); 

ps.setObject in Embedded will throw SQL State 07009 whereas in Network Server, it will throw SQL State XCL13. 
As part of this commit, in the example case above, we will always throw SQL State 07009 in both Embedded and 
Network Server.
