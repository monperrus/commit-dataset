<D:comment>DERBY-3037
With this commit, I am removing the Language Resultset.finish from AlterTableConstantAction. In addition, since
what's being created in this part of AlterTableConstantAction is a single use activation it should be closed when 
its language Resultset is closed. In order to achieve that, I have added following code in NoRowsResultSetImpl.close
to take care of the activation 
+ if (activation.isSingleExecution()) 
+ activation.close(); 

The derbyall and junit tests have run with no problems. Will merge this into 10.3 codeline later.
