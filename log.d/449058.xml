DERBY-1854 (SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE corrupts table with a single column which is bo
th a primary key and a foreign key)

Problem was all the conglomerate descriptor entries in sys.sysconglomerates
were not getting updated with new conglomerate number generated for an index
during compress/bulk-insert, when an index is shared. Update code was assuming
conglomerate id is common when an index is shared, but that is not correct.
ConglomerateID's in sys.sysconglomerates are unique.

This patch modifies the update conglomerate descriptor code to update each
conglomerate descriptor separately using conglomerateID as the key, when
there are more than one conglomerate descriptor referring to the same
conglomerate(conglomerate number).

This patch also adds a test-case to test import into a table that has the same c
olumn as a primary key and foreign key,  import was also causing corruption beca
use of the same problem.  See DERBY-1641 , for details.
