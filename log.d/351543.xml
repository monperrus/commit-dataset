<D:comment>Fix for DERBY-715.  

Sometimes (timing dependent) a lock deadlock was incorrectly returned to the
user as a lock timeout.  The code in LockSet was using the wrong variable
to determine if a deadlock had been detected, that variable sometimes was
right and sometimes wrong.  Changed all the code to use the direct return
from the deadlock detection routine.  Added a test that causes 5 deadlocks,
previous to the fix this test would always report at least 1 timeout on
my single processor, windows xp, laptop.
