<D:comment>DERBY-4067 ClientConnectionPoolDataSource.getPooledConnection and ClientXADataSource.getXAConnection ignore connection attributes 
DERBY-2468 would be nice if traceFile=filename connection attribute would be supported with ClientConnectionPoolDataSource and ClientXADataSource

backported change #965793 from trunk to 10.5 branch

Made two changes:
- moved the parsing of the connection attribute string to before the log
writer is constructed, since the construction may depend on some attributes
specified in the connection attribute string
- added parsing of the connection attribute string to the client ConnectionPool
and XA data sources
Also re-enabled 'testClientMessageTextConnectionAttribute' and removed a
work-around for the issue fixed by this commit.
