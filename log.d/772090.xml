<D:comment>DERBY-4193: ASSERT FAILED Scan position already saved with multi-threaded insert/update/delete

Forget about the current position before trying to reposition on the
end point of a scan. Then the ASSERT won't be confused if it needs to
save the position again (it fails if it finds that a position is
already saved).

BTreeScan.positionAtStartForBackwardScan() also had this problem, but
since it doesn't have any callers, this method was removed instead of
being fixed.
