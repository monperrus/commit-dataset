<D:comment>DERBY-4204: Runtime statistics not collected on re-execution of statement

Make sure NoRowsResultSetImpl.close() prints the collected runtime
statistics each time close() is called on a result set that is not
currently closed. After DERBY-827 close() didn't print the statistics
if the result set had been closed and reopened.
