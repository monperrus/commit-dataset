<D:comment>DERBY-4179 bootLock.java fails with missing exception on z/OS with pmz3160sr2ifix-20081021_01(SR2+IZ32776+IZ33456), and Windows Vista

Patch derby-4179-junit-5:

* Rewrite of boot lock test to JUnit, this also solves the problem
  with running with jars in relative classpaths.

* Added test of effectiveness of derby.database.forceDatabaseLock for
  phoneME platforms, until we implement DERBY-4646. (I could not find
  any other such test).

* Fixed JUnit harness to correctly fork a Sun phoneME vm (image name
  is cvm, not java),

* Added logic to capture what happens to minion (if it fails) by
  capturing its stderr (if it ever gets started, that is), cf. example enclosed.

* Added socket logic to communicate to parent when minion has booted
  the "dual boot" candidate to avoid having to wait for 30 seconds or
  more to be sure it has done so. Test now runs in a few seconds.

* Skips test for j9 for now, since this platform fails on the fork
  operation according to Kathey, cf DERBY-4647.
