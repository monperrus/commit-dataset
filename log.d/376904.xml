<D:comment>DERBY-210 test case checkin in preparation for DERBY-210 fix
 Attaching second patch 'derby-210-patch2.diff' which adds a test to jdbcapi suite for this issue. Patch does the following:

* Adds a test derbyStress.java to jdbcapi suite. This test is based on the repro for this patch.
* Excludes the new test from running with client driver, jcc and j9 because it gives out of memory error. Once derby-210 is resolved, this test should pass with client driver and the exclude must be removed from DerbyNetClient.exclude
* Creates 'derbyStress_app.properties' with following property 'jvmflags=-Xmx64M' to guarantee the test fails on all machines with the current client driver.

I ran jdbcapi suite with all frameworks using Sun JDK1.4.2 on Windows XP. Verified that the new test gets run with embedded and is skipped for client and jcc frameworks. Also ran the new test with j9 vms. Verified it passes with j9_foundation and is skipped for other j9s. Please take a look at this patch.
