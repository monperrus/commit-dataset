Increase the maximum wait time for tests that start the server.  On my 
windows XP system I would get intermittent failures at the old 60 second
max.  I believe the issue is turnaround time on the port, rather than a
specific startup issue in the code.  Setting the max to 300 seconds allowed
me to pass a complete nightly test and also passed a reiterated test 30 times
that would previously fail every time at the 60 second level.
