<D:comment>DERBY-3304

This is a followup commit for DERBY-3304 based on various comments. It does following
1)The existing method resetActivations in GenericLanguageConnectionContext has been renamed to better reflect it's
functionality. It will be now called endTransactionActivationHandling since it gets called for commit/rollback.
2)The javadoc comments for resetActivations(now called endTransactionActivationHandling) were not valid. Fixed that in 
this commit.
3)Took out the redundant code about setting the holdability to false if we were in rollback. It was needed earlier
because the method that took care of activations at rollback time needed to check the holdability. That method
(BaseActivation.reset) does not check holdability anymore and hence we do not need to set the activations to false
holdability when we are dealing with rollback.
4)Lastly, JDBC api for Connection.commit does not ask for clearing of warnings and hence we should not have code to
clear the warnings at the time of commit. I removed the warning clearing code from resetActivations(now called 
endTransactionActivationHandling) in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.
