<D:comment>DERBY-1149 : Fix failures in StatementTest.java.  I also added
a new constants file for testing that contains all the standard
SQL State strings.  Derby-specific SQL States can be added as
needed.

Passes derbyall, except for the sysinfo tests, which is a known regression
when running against the classes directory.
