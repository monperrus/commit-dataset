<D:comment>DERBY-4125: The in-memory storage back end doesn't work on Windows.
Changed the in-memory storage factory to rely much more on java.io.File to
handle paths and names.
The data store now stores all files and directories with normalized paths.
Also fixed a bug in DataStore.deleteEntry for deletion of directories.
Added two more tests; testListChildren and testCreateRoot.

Patch file: derby-4125-1a-improved_path_handling.diff
