<D:comment>Enhance ManifestHeaderProcessor to support Provide-Capability and Require-Capability style headers. The functionality can be found in:
  ManifestHeaderProcessor.parseCapabilityString()
  ManifestHeaderProcessor.parseRequirementString()
Currently the implementation of both is exactly the same under the hood, but I introduced them as separate methods to make make usage feel more naturally. It will also allow fixes to them individually in the future if needed.
