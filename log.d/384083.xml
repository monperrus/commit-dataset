<D:comment>DERBY-937

Fixing typo in the no timeout setting for this test.  it should have
been derby.optimizer.noTimeout=true not derby.optimize.noTimeout=true.
Unfortunately did this did not fix the diffs I am seeing on my machine, but
it clearly makes sense for this test to set no timeout to eliminate the
variance of running this test on a number of different speeds of hardware.
Maybe this change will help others, at least it will eliminate one variable
as we continue to track down the cause.
