<D:comment>DERBY-5108: Intermittent failure in AutomaticIndexStatisticsTest.testShutdownWhileScanningThenDelete on Windows 

Shut down the istat daemon thread at an earlier stage when the database is
being shut down (user initiated or due to a severe error). This should avoid
the problem where file containers are reopened by the istat daemon after the
container cache has been shut down.

Patch file: derby-5108-2a-early_istats_shutdown_broad.diff
