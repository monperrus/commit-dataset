<D:comment>Fix a problem building with -Dsane=false. The ensuresanitystate target
would cause sanity to be set to true even though sane=false and the correct
SanityState.java and state.properties were generated. Also update BUILDING.txt
to remove the mention of the property 'sanity' which should only be set from
state.properties.
