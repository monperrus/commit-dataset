<D:comment>Merging revision 629395 from trunk into 10.3 codeline. The reason for merge is I would like
to merge changes for DERBY-3304 (629926) into trunk but that revision depends on
DERBY-3404 (629712) which depends on DERBY-3422 (629395)

The commit comments for 629395 were as follows

DERBY-3422: Embedded returns wrong value for DatabaseMetaData.autoCommitFailureClosesAllResultSets()

Return the correct value (true) and update the test so that it is able
to detect differences between returned value and actual behaviour.
