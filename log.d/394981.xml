<D:comment>DERBY-1113, committing on behalf of Suresh Thalamati

 The reason for missing log files is truncation logic at checkpoint was
 incorrectly deleting the log files that were needed for crash recovery
 if the backup is progress at the same time; The first log file that should
     not be deleted was incorrectly assigned to the log file number that is yet
     to be written to the backup.

     Attached patch changes the logic, so that all the log files that are required for both crash recovery and the backup are not deleted. Basically the first log file that should not be deleted is the lowest of first log needed for crash recovery or the log file that is yet to be copied to the backup.
