<D:comment>LUCENE-736: Sloppy phrase query with repeating terms matches wrong docs.
For example query "B C B"~2 matches the doc "A B C D E".
Search time cost of this fix is 4%, for sloppy phrase search. 
This fix also partially brings back the the tests checkSkipTo() in QueryUtils, 
(which was disabled by LUCENE-730), but this is now invoked 
only for non Boolean scorers.
