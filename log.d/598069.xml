<D:comment>DERBY-3119  Derby does not resolve functions to methods with Integer return type.

Committed DERBY-3119-10_3.diff, which is a modified version of svn
589766, since that patch didn't apply cleanly due to other changes on
trunk (VTIs). I verified that the new test in RoutineTest failed
without the patch in MethodCallNode and worked when it was applied. 

Original patch contributed by James F. Adams.
