<D:comment>DERBY-966 DERBY-1005 1) Change DRDAStatement to use the EngineConnection.prepareStatement() method that has a holdability
 parameter. This ensures prepares on a connection that was obtained from a XADataSource
(or a ConnectionPoolDataSource) do not lose the holdability requested by the application.

2) Change the client's state of holdability to match the embedded in that a Connection's holdability
 is set to close cursors on commit when it has an active global XA transaction.
Merge of 380278, partially manually due to conflicts, from trunk.
