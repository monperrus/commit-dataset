<D:comment>DERBY-898 setAutoCommit(false) is not working properly with connections objtained with ClientXADataSource.

- Changes server side connection for network server XA to autocommit false. Even when the client has autocommit on, the server side connection should be autocommit false and let the client drive the commits.

- Adds connections obtained from an XADataSource to the savepointJdbc30_XA test to verify that autocommit is being set properly and also verify that DERBY-899 (a dup of this issue) is fixed.
