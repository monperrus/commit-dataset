<D:comment>DERBY-2380 (partial) Change language PreparedStatement to not implement the Provider
interface from the DependencyManager. This is a step to cleaning up the life-cycle
of a PreparedStatement so that it will act like a Java object, if one has a reference
to it then it can be used. Remove the single use of any object being dependent
on a PreparedStatement which was a PreparedStatement for a positioned delete/update
being dependent on the current statement the cursor maps to. This is already handled
in a more general case since the positioned statement must cope with the statement
for the cursor changing completely without any invalidation. Also the positioned
statement has its own dependency on the table being modified so will be recompiled
through that mechanism if the table changes in any way.</D:comment>
