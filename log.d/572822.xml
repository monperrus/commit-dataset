<D:comment>DERBY-2905 (partial) Add test fixtures to test that after an embedded shutdown that no
Derby driver is left registered and that a subsequent load of the embedded driver succeeds.
The assert for no driver left registered is disabled until DERBY-2905 is fixed.
Inspired by Ramin Moazeni's patch v3 attached to the Jira issue.</D:comment>
