<D:comment>DERBY-4275: Query executions fail when compressing a table using SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE

Move invalidation of dependent statements until the system tables have
been updated with information about the new conglomerates created by
compression or truncation. This is to prevent that statements
executing concurrently get recompiled too early and don't see the new
conglomerates (and therefore fail on subsequent executions because
they cannot find the old conglomerates).</D:comment>
