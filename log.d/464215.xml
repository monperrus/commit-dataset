<D:comment>DERBY-630: CREATE TRIGGER fails with null pointer exception

This patch was contributed by Yip Ng (yipng168@gmail.com)

The current implementation for CREATE TRIGGER needs to handle null compilation
schema. A compilation schema with null value indicates that the
trigger action statement text does not depend on the current schema. This means:

1. It is safe to compile this statement in any schema since there is no dependency with
    the CURRENT SCHEMA. i.e.: All relevent fields are qualified with a specific schema.

2. The statement cache mechanism can utilize this piece of information to enable
    better statement plan sharing across different schemas; thus, avoiding unnecessary
    statement compilation.

 
So the proposal is:

a) Allow null compilation schema. The system catalog first needs to change the
   compiliation schema id column of SYS.SYSSTATEMENTS and SYS.SYSVIEWS system
   table's nullability to true. This would also require a soft upgrade for the
   previous versions of Derby. This step will resolve the NPE problem of this jira.

b) Handle null compilation schema in statement preparation logic. This can be filed
   as a separate jira as improvement. It may require some work on the SQL parser to
   determine whether the compiled statement depends on the CURRENT SCHEMA or not, so
   that the compilation schema can be properly set.
