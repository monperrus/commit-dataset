<D:comment>DERBY-170  Inserting large string value into non-existent table causes communication link failure over Network Server.

 Attached is a proposed patch for DERBY-170, which teaches the skipDSS method how to handle segmented DDM objects. changes.html attached to DERBY-170  provides a bit of background and discussion for the reviewer. I have successfully run derbyall with this patch. The patch includes a new test, and new master output files.
