<D:comment>merge from trunk:
Reenable the test: The bug was that all classes (even test classes) were handled as SolrInfoMBeans, so the test loaded all classes. Some tests initialized statics at the wrong time. This patch adds a check, that only build/solr classes are loaded by classloader.
If there are still problems, we may have solr core classes, that initialize statics in a wrong way. In this case we have to fix those, these are real bugs!</D:comment>
