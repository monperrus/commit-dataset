<D:comment>DERBY-176 (partial) Add the initial utility code and split algorithm
to split a single generated method that execeeds the java virtual
machine limit of 65535 bytes of instructions. Allows the byte-code api
caller to generate code without worrying about exceeding the limit.
The initial split algorithm is the ability to split methods
that consist of multiple independent statements, seen by the stack
depth dropping to zero after a statement.
In the largeCodeGen test this change allowed the number of parameters
in the IN list query to increase from 3,400 to 97,000. The limit hit
at 98,000 was the number of constant pool entries.
