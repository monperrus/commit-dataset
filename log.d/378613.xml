<D:comment>DERBY-960 Client xa prepare returns XA_OK instead of XA_RDONLY for a read only transaction

- Changed DRDAXAProtocol prepareXATransaction to return the return value of prepare in the SYNCCRD
The server was always returning XA_OK if prepare did not throw an error instead of passing the return value to the client.

For Network Client
- Changed NetXAResource() prepare to handle XA_RDONLY returned from the server. It was throwing an exception for any value returned from the server other than XA_OK.

Test was checked in by enabling checkDataSource30.java in svn  378532
