<D:comment>DERBY-6184: Clean up warnings in XA transaction id classes

- simplify existing cloning of arrays by using clone() instead of
  calling new and arraycopy

- reduce visibility of array-returning methods in GlobalXactId to make
  it clearer for code analysis tools that they are not called from
  outside of the package in which the class lives

- remove said methods from the GlobalTransactionId to allow them to be
  non-public

- make the public, array-returning methods in XAXactId return copies
  of the internal arrays to protect the internal state, as instances
  of this class may be returned all the way out to the user</D:comment>
