<D:comment>DERBY-4263: PropertySetter isn't able to recognize JDK without version number in path.
Added a new algorithm for detecting JDKs on the system. The root search
locations are the same as before, but instead of relying on version numbers in
the JDK directory, jar files and the sub directory structure of the directories
are examined. The new algorithm will try to select JDKs from the same vendor as
the running JVM if possible.
If the new algorithm fails for some reason, the old one will be used.
If both the new and the old algorithm fail, a last attempt will be made by
configuring the build with the running JVM only.

If the more "exotic" approaches are used, a warning message will be printed
to default out. As before, more information can be extracted by setting
printCompilerProperties=true when invoking ant.
