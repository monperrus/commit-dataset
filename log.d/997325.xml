<D:comment>DERBY-4712 Complex nested joins problems

Patch DERBY-4712b, which removes one of the source for NPE seen by the reporter.
The other is covered by DERBY-4798.

A corner case: the patch makes an inner join which decides it is not
flattenable, propagate this fact down to any nested outer join nodes
containing nested inner joins, the latter inner joins will otherwise
think they are flattenable (a priori value for inner joins).

Adds new test cases.
