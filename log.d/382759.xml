<D:comment>DERBY-965: DatabaseMetadata method supportsResultSetConcurrency
returns wrong result on network client

This patch (derby965b-v1) updates the master for phaseTester.java.
This test is not part of derbyall and the master must be manually
compared with the output of the phase tests, cf description in
DERBY-573.

phaseTester runs metadata_test.java as part of its work, so the master
needs to be updated whenever metadata_test.java changes (as this issue
does).

Note: Even with this patch, phaseTester when run as described,
failed. I noticed the following:

- the shell script driving it is WIndows specific (";" as classpath
  delimiter)

- in the soft upgrade phase, the metadata test fails (table not
  found), when performing a stored procedure: 'CALL
  SYSIBM.SQLCOLPRIVILEGES' (in odbc_metadata#getMetadataRS).
  
This patch lessens the diff between the master and the "current"
output, though, so i think it should be committed.
