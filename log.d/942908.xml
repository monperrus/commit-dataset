<D:comment>DERBY-4343 ASSERT FAILED calling setTransactionIsolation checking isolation_ == level on pooled connection

This is just the test case for this issue. The issue itself was actually fixed with DERBY-4314. Also included is one DERBY-4314 test case to make sure piggybacking works ok after statement execution.
