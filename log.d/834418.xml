<D:comment>DERBY-4432: Memory leak when attempting to boot non-existing database with the in-memory back end.
Fixed memory leak happening when trying to boot non-existing databases by using a dummy store to handle operations that don't require a proper store.
Added a regression test (must be run with a small Java heap).
Also changed the existing test by using a discarding log writer to avoid writing a huge log file to disk (a message is logged for each failed boot).

Patch file: derby-4432-1a-mem_leak_fix.diff
