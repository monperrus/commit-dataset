<D:comment>Took out a massive bunch of stuff that Jan pointed out I managed to introduce into the file inappropriately, I *think* I did a poor merge.

SOLR-2819 and SOLR-2919 are the JIRAs that have been checked in since I screwed it up, and I *think* I have them back in the right place, but Muir and Hoss might want to check considering my not-so-stellar record on this nonsense.</D:comment>
