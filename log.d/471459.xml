<D:comment>DERBY-2014: NullPointerException with NULLIF in GROUP BY clause

This change was contributed by Yip Ng (yipng168@gmail.com)

The NPE happens in isEquivalent() method where it does not handle
value is null. (same symptom as DERBY-2008) and the patch addresses
this + additonal testcases.

The isEquivalent() method is used to compare the select column
against the group by with expression. Note that it is comparing
the structural form of the two expressions for equivalence at bind phase
and not comparing the actual row values at runtime to produce a result.

This patch converts all the tests in the previous patch into junit.
Also the javadoc for ValueNode.isEquivalent() method has been updated.
