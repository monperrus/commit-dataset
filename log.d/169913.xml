<D:comment>his patch fixes Derby 236  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-236 - BootPassword gets written out in plain text in sane mode and in our test environment.

Changes include

1. remove sanity debug code in RawStore to not write bootpassword in plain text into the service.properties 2. currently the test harness does not seem to pass on the encryption related properties to the MultiTest and with change in #1, encryption wont be used for stress.multi. So changes made to  RunTest to pass on the encryption, testEncryptionAlgorithm values to the MultiTest harness. Also changed mtTestCase to recognize the encryption properties and modify the database url to use for the MultiTest.
ran derbyall on jdk142 with no failures
verified that encryption run for stress.multi was running ok, by adding keepfiles=true to encryptionAll.properties and checking the service.properties for all the databases created as part of this encryptionAll testrun.
