<D:comment>DERBY-4679 Several left outer joins causes unstable query with incorrect results

Follow-up patch derby-4679-2a, which makes the new (tn, cn) based
remapping work also for a CR to a subquery join participant being rebound
after flattening, see detailed comments in the code.  Extra test cases
are added to JoinTest#testDerby_4679
