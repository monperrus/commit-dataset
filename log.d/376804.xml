<D:comment>DERBY-907 regression test failure in RecoveryAfterBackup on wssd5.6 ibm jvm (j2me)

* Modifies app_properties files to add ij.dataSource properties. Also changed 'database' to 'ij.database' property. Removed usedefaults to avoid conflict with default property.
* Adds a method getConnection to TestUtil to get connection using different set of attributes than what is specified in _app.properties file.
* Changes the test store/RecoveryAfterBackup to use the above method to shutdown and get connection. I'll change other tests to use the new method in a later patch.

With the patch, I ran the RecoveryAfterBackup tests with Sun JDK1.4.2, j9 and j9 foundation vm.
