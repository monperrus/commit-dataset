<D:comment>fix the bootstrap interaction with gossip; there were two main problems:
1) token and bootstrap state are not guaranteed to be gossiped together; since we only updated TMD.bootstrapNodes on an update of the token, this means we could actually miss the bootstrap notice
2) deletions of state are not actually supported by Gossiper; there is no concept of that at the protocol level. so if we delete state locally it will never get gossiped. Instead, we have a MODE that is either MOVING or NORMAL, corresponding to bootstrap &amp; normal operation.
