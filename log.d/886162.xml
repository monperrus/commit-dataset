<D:comment>DERBY-3947: Cannot insert 994 char string into indexed column

A table created with "CREATE TABLE t (x varchar(1000) primary key)" could
encounter problems when a particularly long value of "x" was inserted,
because the index that was automatically created to support the PRIMARY KEY
constraint was created with a small page size. Such an insert statement
would get an error like: "Limitation: Record of a btree secondary index
cannot be updated or inserted due to lack of space on the page."

This change enhances TableElementList so that, when creating an index for
a constraint, it now checks the approximate length of the columns in the
index, and, if they are sufficiently long, automatically chooses a larger
default page size for the index conglomerate.
