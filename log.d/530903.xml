<D:comment>DERBY-2568: Removed LobStreamsTests from the suite encodingTests in the old harness. The test is still run in JUnit, but not with special encoding. Started failing because both the old harness and the new JUnit framwork were starting/stopping the networkserver (configuration changed from embedded only to embedded pluss client/server at the JUnit level).
