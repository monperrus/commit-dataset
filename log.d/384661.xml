<D:comment>DERBY-1042: committed on behalf of Suresh Thalamati

I could not reproduce this problem on my machine. By looking at the code I
found backup is getting unblocked before the post commit work is done.
This may cause the error that is reported, if the jar files to copied to the
backup is deleted by the post commit. Attached patch unblocks the backup
only after the post commit work that is schedules to run in the same
transaction is done. While scanning the code for this problem, I also noticed
couple of other small issues, this patch addresses them also.


DERBY-1042:

-- unblock the backup only after the post commit work to be done on the same
transaction is complete.
-- when backup is in progress drop stub files are not deleted during
checkpoint. These are necessary to perform recovery starting from the
backup checkpoint.
-- synchronized getContaineNames() that gets the containers to be written to
the backup. This method need to be synchronized so that other privileged
actions does not run in parallel and vice versa.

-- Modified the OnlineBackupTest1.java and OnlineBackupTest3.java tests to
abort if there is a error during the backup instead of waiting incorrectly
for the failed backup to complete forever.
