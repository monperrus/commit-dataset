<D:comment>DERBY -378 (partial)
This patch adds code required to support import/export of a table with
CHAR FOR BIT DATA, VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA,  LONG VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA
data types. Data of this type of columns is exported to the main export 
file as hex strings. On import data is also expected to be in hex strings 
in the main export file for these type of columns. This patch also 
disallows use of hex decimal characters (0-9 , a-f , A-F) as 
delimiters for import/export procedures. 

Maximum data length of these types is only  32700 ( 254 bytes for CHAR FOR 
BIT DATA , 32,672 for VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA and  32700 LONG VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA). 
Because max length allowed is less than 32k, I think providing import/Export
using an external file for these types may not add much value. No external 
file support will be provided for these types. It can be added later, 
if some one thinks it is required. 

Tests:
Added a new junit test to test the import/export of these binary types. 


It would be great if someone can review this patch.
