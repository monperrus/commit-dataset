<D:comment>DERBY-1861: ASSERT when combining references and expressions in ORDER BY

An ORDER BY clause wihch combines both column references and expressions
causes the sort engine to throw an ASSERT failure in sane builds.

The data structure problems that are exposed by DERBY-1861 both have to do
with the duplicate elimination processing. When the duplicate pulled-up
columns are eliminated from the result column list, the OrderByColumn and
ResultColumn instances may both end up with incorrect values.

The OrderByColumn class contains a field named addedColumnOffset. This
field records the offset of this particular OrderByColumn within the
portion of the result column list which contains pulled-up columns.
Each time a column is pulled up into the result column list, its
addedColumnOffset is set; thus the first pulled-up column has
addedColumnOffset = 0, the second pulled-up column has
addedColumnOffset = 1, etc.

However, later, when duplicate pulled-up result columns are detected
and removed by bind processing, the addedColumnOffset field is not
re-adjusted, and ends up with an invalid value. 

The ResultColumn class contains a field named virtualColumnId. For columns
which are not directly from the underlying table, but rather are the result
of expressions that are computed at runtime, the columns are assigned a
virtualColumnId. For reasons similar to those of the addedColumnOffset,
this field also ends up wiht an invalid value when the duplicate
pulled-up columns are detected and removed from the result column list.

I decided that the best thing was to arrange to call each of the
OrderByColumn instances and ResultColumn instances at the point that
the duplicate result column is detected and removed, to give each of
those objects a chance to adjust its addedColumnOffset and
virtualColumnId value to reflect the removed column. Although this change
required a number of small changes, none of them was terribly complicated,
and the effect of the fix is that the data structures are as desired.
