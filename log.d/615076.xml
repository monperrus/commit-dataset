<D:comment>DERBY-3214: Account for loss of precision that can occur when very
large cost estimates are added to, and then subtracted from, relatively
small cumulative estimates during Optimizable "pull" processing.

Merging from trunk to 10.3 branch.  Following commands ran cleanly:

  svn merge -r 603658:603659 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk
  svn merge -r 604512:604513 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk

No other changes were required.
