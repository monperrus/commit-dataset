<D:comment>DERBY-1785
contributed by Myrna van Lunteren
patch: DERBY-1785_20061007.diff

Attaching a band-aid patch for this issue. I chose to comment out the method 
rather than remove as a way to document the quirky behavior.

Having the method setSecurityProps overload the one in jvm.java causes 
problems when running the junit tests - they *do* successfully run with 
securityManager.
Foundation class tests actually run ok with security manager - except when 
useprocess is false. This is caused by a bug in the jvm. See also DERBY-885.
