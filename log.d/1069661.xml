<D:comment>DERBY-5005 Error when fully qualifying a field from a view in an ORDER BY clause

Patch derby-5005b. It makes FromSubquery implement its own
getFromTableByName instead of using the abstract superclass
FromTable's implementation which returns null when an explicit schema
is used (a view is represented a FromSubquery here), cf. the comment
in the default implementation:

"Only FromBaseTables have schema names"

which isn't quite true; views can have them, too.

Added a new test, lang.Derby5005Test instead of adding to the harness
test orderby.sql. Made a note in orderby.sql to merge with
Derby5005Test when that test gets rewritten to JUnit.
