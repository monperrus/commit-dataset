<D:comment>OE system test improvements - Ensure that the Checks text fixtures for the OETest actually cause a failure if they find a problem, previously they were just printing an error since that's what the core class OEChecks was doing. Adding a simple class HandleCheckError to allow OEChecks to be isolated from JUnit but allow the JUnit Checks class to use Assert.fail() to report issues found by OEChecks.</D:comment>
