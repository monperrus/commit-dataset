<D:comment>ARIES-941, ARIES-943: Root subsystem region selection and region cleanup.

The root subsystem is now associated with the region in which the subsystems implementation bundle is installed. Previously, it
was always associated with the kernel region.

Regions are now properly removed when a subsystem is uninstalled.

New tests were added for both issues.</D:comment>
