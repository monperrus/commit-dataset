<D:comment>DERBY-5185 store/rollForwardRecovery.sql stuck in RAFContainer4.recoverContainerAfterInterrupt() during shutdown

Patch derby-5185-2b which fixes state a state maintenance bugs (in
threadDoingRestore/restoreChannelInProgress) maintenance when throwing
FILE_IO_INTERRUPTED. The first fixes the immediate problem.

It also adds a maximum number of retries for the readPage code and
fixes some cases whereby the state variable "threadsInPageIO" could
risk not being properly update when exceptions would get thrown. The
latter may be the underlying reason for what we see here.
