<D:comment>DERBY-6283 indexStat daemon processing tables over and over even when there are no changes in the tables in soft upgraded database.

Changed system to always drop orphaned stats during update statistics call.  

Without this change soft upgraded systems running on 10.8 or higher derby 
software, that had an orphaned statistic would spin forever in the index 
stat daemon due to the same problem fixed by DERBY-5680 for hard 
upgraded databases.
