<D:comment>DERBY-2351: ORDER BY with expression with distinct in SELECT list.

This is a follow-on patch for DERBY-2351, which addresses a number of
problems involving column aliasing that occurred with the initial
DERBY-2351 patch. After the initial DERBY-2351 patch, queries such as
the following one failed:

   select distinct c1 as a1 from t order by c1

This patch modifies the ORDER BY column matching algorithm to
match column references using multiple rules, depending on
whether or not the ORDER BY reference is qualified or not:
 - unqualified references are matched first against the alias name,
   then against the underlying column name from the source table
 - qualified references are matched only against the underlying
   specified table

A number of additional test cases are added as part of this patch to verify
that the above query, and other similar queries, now work as intended.

This patch rejects at least one query known to have worked before:

    select t1.id as idc1, t1.id as idc2 from t1 order by t1.idc1, t1.idc2; 

After discussion with Derby developers, this query was felt to
be invalid, as there is no such column "idc1" in table "t1". The query
should *not* qualify the ORDER BY column references with table "t1":

    select t1.id as idc1, t1.id as idc2 from t1 order by idc1, idc2;
