<D:comment>DERBY-4297: XplainStatisticsTest 'compilation time did not compute'

This change adjusts the technique used to compute the compileTime counter
in GenericStatement.prepMinion so that the following invariant will hold:

  parseTime + bindTime + optimizeTime + generateTime = compileTime

Previously, there was a small window after generateTime had been computed
but before compileTime had been recorded, during which the value of the
System.currentTimeMillis clock could change, resulting in a situation where
compileTime was too large, typically by 15 or 16 milliseconds.
