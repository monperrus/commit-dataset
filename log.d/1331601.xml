<D:comment>DERBY-5686; multiple intermittent errors in nightly tests during DriverMgrAuthenticationTest test. reason: An SQL data change is not permitted for a read-only connection, user or database. 
  committing patch DERBY_5686_1.diff (after removing some unnecessary imports).
  Hopefully this will give us at least some insight into what's happening when
  this happens during teardown of the DatabasePropertyTestSetup.
