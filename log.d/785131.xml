<D:comment>DERBY-4246 .replicationTests.ReplicationRun_Local_3_p5).testReplication_Local_3_p5_DERBY_3878()' fails w/ "Could not perform operation 'stopSlave' because the database '...' has not been booted

Patch derby-4246-2 adds extra logic to the stop slave action after the
master is killed. This logic anticipates the slave's state changes
before its down. This logic was also present in
ReplicationRun_Local_StateTest_part1_1, so this patch factors this out
into a new method to stopSlave in ReplicationRun.
