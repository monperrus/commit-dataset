<D:comment>DERBY-1909: ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN needs to update GRANTed privileges

When ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN is used to drop a column from a table, it needs to update the GRANTed column privileges on that table.

The core of this proposed patch involves refactoring and reusing the
DERBY-1847 method which knows how to rewrite SYSCOLPERMS rows
to update the COLUMNS column. The DERBY-1847 version of that code
only handled the case of adding a bit to the COLUMNS column; this patch
extends that method to support removing a bit from the COLUMNS
column as well, then calls the method from the AlterTable execution logic.
