<D:comment>DERBY-2370: Fix incorrect results for EXISTS queries with SET operator
expressions.  In particular:

  1. Adds the ability to mark a FromList as "transparent", and updates
     FromList.bindExpressions() to pass the outer FROM list down (instead
     of "this") if the FromList is transparent.
  2. Updates FromList.expandAll(...) to account for the fact that outer
     FROM tables might now appear in a nested FromList (as a result of
     "transparent" FromLists; see code comments for details).
  3. Modifies the "setResultToBooleanTrue()" signature to return a
     ResultSetNode (it was "void" previously).
  4. Modifies ResultSetNode.setResultToBooleanTrue() to always return "this".
  5. Modifies SetOperatorNode.setResultToBooleanTrue() so that it now creates
     an internal "SELECT *" query whose FROM list contains just the
     SetOperatorNode. Then we transform the "*" for the new SELECT into "TRUE"
     and leave the SetOperatorNode's result columns UN-transformed. Finally,
     mark the new SelectNode's FromList as "transparent" and return the new
     SelectNode. 
  6. Updates tests where necessary (including changed behavior in union.sql)
     and adds a new JUnit test, lang/ExistsWithSetOpsTest, to verify new
     behavior.
