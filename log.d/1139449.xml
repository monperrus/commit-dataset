<D:comment>DERBY-5289 Unable to boot 10.5.1.1 database - fails during soft/hard upgrade process for a new version number while trying to drop jdbc metadata

Checking testcase for DERBY-5289. In trunk theDERBY-3870 fix contributed by Knut Anders Hatlen fixed the issue so no code change is needed. Just the portion of DERBY-3870 that is relevant to DERBY-5289 will be backported to the other branches.

Script to reproduce the problem which is the basis for the testcase was contributed by Brett Mason
