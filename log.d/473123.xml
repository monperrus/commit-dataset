<D:comment>DERBY-2063 (partial) Change ShutdownDBWhenNSShutsDown from being a JUnit test run under the old
harness to one that is run as a regular JUnit tests. Add a new _Suite for derbynet and hook it
into suites.All and the ant junit-all target. Required fixing some bugs in the DriverManager
connection handling. Also refactored NetworkServerTestSetup to allow starting the server
from the "command line" and to provide some utility methods for tests, e.g. to get
a correctly setup NetworkServerControl.</D:comment>
