<D:comment>DERBY-4500: setNetworkClientCP should use return, not exit, on error

Since the setNetworkClientCP and setNetworkServerCP scripts are designed
to be called from another script, or sourced from the shell, they should
use 'return' rather than 'exit', to report an error.

This change was contributed by John Storta, Jr. (js at storta dot net).
