<D:comment>DERBY-3904: NPE on left join with aggregate

The issue involves a very special optimization that is performed
for MIN and MAX queries in which we may be able to use an index
to go directly to the lowest/highest value of the desired column.
For example, in the query

  SELECT MAX(d1) FROM t1

if there is an index on d1, we can use that index to retrieve
the max value very rapidly. In order to incorporate this
optimization, the following conditions must be met:

 - No group by
 - One of:
   - min/max(ColumnReference) is only aggregate &amp;&amp; source is
     ordered on the ColumnReference
   - min/max(ConstantNode)
The optimization of the other way around (min with desc index or
max with asc index) has the same restrictions with the additional
temporary restriction of no qualifications at all (because
we don't have true backward scans). 

The source of the data must also be "simple" (not a result of a join),
and the NullPointerException occurred during the code that tried
to establish the above conditions because it wasn't thoroughly
enough excluding the join case. In the query:

  SELECT MAX( T1.D1 ) AS D FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.D1 = T2.D2
  WHERE T2.D2 IS NULL

the code in GroupByNode.considerPostOptimizeOptimizations was
trying to traverse the AccessPathImpl to find the index scan
information, but for this LEFT JOIN case there is an AccessPathImpl
but no index scan information, because there is a join being
performed, not an index scan.

The solution is to examine the AccessPathImpl more carefully,
and only search the index scan information if an index scan
is actually present.

Also added a few tests, including an enhancement to the test
library's RuntimeStatisticsParser so that it can determine
if a Last Key Index Scan is being performed by the query.
