<D:comment>[ARIES-986] The blueprint extender does not support high concurrency very well

Make sure that containers destruction is synchronous even when multi-threaded by blocking until the destruction is finished.  Delegate more work on the BundleTracker.  Make sure all threads are stopped while stopping a container, better support for having the bundle stopped while creating the container, which can happen because the framework does not hold the bundle lock while firing the STARTED event.
