<D:comment>fix race condition in compaction -- it was possible for a read thread to "snapshot" ssTables_, then have
the compactor thread delete those (after merging them into a new file) before the read thread checked
them.  Since the read thread's "snapshot" doesn't include the new merged sstable, it incorrectly tells
the caller that the key does not exist.
