<D:comment>DERBY-4741 Make Derby work reliably in the presence of thread interrupts

Patch derby-4741-a-04-api-interruptstatus. This patch contains the new
helper class InterruptStatus and inserts calls to
restoreIntrFlagIfSeen in before API methods' return and in the
exception handling (TransactionResourceImpl#handleException).

In addition, execution of EmbedStatement#executeBatch checks for
interrupts between each statement in the batch and throws the
exisisting 08000 (CONN_INTERRUPT - session level severity) error if
interrupts are seen.

Note: Still, the machinery of InterruptStatus isn't really used to
save any interrupts, that follows in (a) later patch(es), so this
patch doesn't change behavior. The focus here is on the correct
placement of calls to restoreIntrFlagIfSeen in the API.
