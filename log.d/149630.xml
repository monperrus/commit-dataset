<D:comment>Fixed Bug 4555. Possible NullPointerException when a short term with
substitutions was being checked for a particle denotion. Length checking
corrected, and sequence of resubstitution and removing particle denotion
changed to prevent denoted term to pass through remove because of the
reduced length.
Corrected and improved documentation.
Fix in WordlistLoader, files are not read correct, loosing a line.
Fix in GermanStemFilter, typo in constructor with custom exclusion table as
parameter, parameter was ignored.
GermanStemFilter has two new Methods for setting stemmer and exclusion
list after creating the filter object.
