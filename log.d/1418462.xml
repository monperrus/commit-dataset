<D:comment>[ARIES-982] Deadlock between Subsystems EventHook and Activator

The bundle event hook will now queue events received while subsystems is still initializing. Once initialization is complete,
the activator notifies the hook. Any pending events are then processed asynchronously. Events received after initialization
is complete are processed synchronously as before.</D:comment>
