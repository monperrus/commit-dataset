Attached patch increases the maximum possible  log file number to  231 -1  and  keeps the  old limit of 222-1 on soft upgrade.
Earlier patch for this problem increased it to 233 -1 , but that fix created  upgrade problems because of  the  additional bits
that are used from  the file position field,  so the limit is being reduced to  231-1.
