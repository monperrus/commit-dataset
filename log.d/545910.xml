<D:comment>DERBY-2770: testBlobAfterCommit(....jdbcapi.BlobClob4BlobTest) fails
with 'Unexpected SQL state. expected:&lt;XJ[073]&gt; but was:&lt;XJ[215]&gt;'

Changed error message to reflect that XJ215 is used both after free()
has been called on a Lob and after the lob's transaction has been
committed.

Changed SQL state when locators are invalid from XJ073 to XJ215 on the
client driver.
