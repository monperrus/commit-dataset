<D:comment>DERBY-4610: Error attempting delete with cascade and triggers

Backed out the fix for DERBY-3049 (four commits) using this command:

    svn merge -c -601395,-600678,-598739,-572753 .

Additionally, two import statements that had been removed in later
commits had to be reintroduced manually in
BasicNoPutResultSetImpl.java and TemporaryRowHolderImpl.java.
