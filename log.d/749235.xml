<D:comment>DERBY-4060: Blob.getBinaryStream(long,long) is off by one for the pos+len check.
Changed the pos/length checks to allow obtaining a stream reading the last
byte/char from the LOB.
The JavaDoc for Blob.getBinaryStream(long,long) and
Clob.getCharacterStream(long,long) (JDBC 4.0) incorrectly states that the
position plus the requested length of the stream cannot be larger than the
length of the LOB. Since positions in JDBC are 1-based, this makes it impossible
to read the last byte/char in the LOB. Derby adhered to the spec.

The changes to CharAlphabet/LoopingAlphabetReader were done to allow passing
an alphabet object around for constructing streams.
