<D:comment>DERBY-5680: indexStat daemon processing tables over an over even when there are no changes in the tables 

Added functionality in the update statistics code to drop statistics considered
disposable; orphaned (i.e. the referenced index doesn't exist), or not
required (the optimizer doesn't need the statistics).
Disposable statistics are only dropped when the istat daemon kicks in, or
SYSCS_UPDATE_STATISTICS is run without specifying an index.
The functionality is not enabled for soft-upgraded databases.
Included a debug property to force the old behavior.
