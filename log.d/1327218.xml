<D:comment>DERBY-5494

Prior to this fix the nested user update transaction used by sequence updater
was doing a "lazy" commit, where the log record for the commit waw written
to the stream but not forced to disk.  It would get forced to disk by any
subsequent user transaction commit.

Changed system to default doing a real commit for all nested user update
transactions, and those that don't need that behavior should use commitNoSync().
Changed identity columns to use the commitNoSync() to keep same performance
for those operations.

Includes the test contributed by rickh as part of DERBY-5493 change.
