<D:comment>DERBY-4282: Strange behavior with "where current of" in CheckConstraintTest

This patch was contributed by Eranda Sooriyabandara (070468D at gmail dot com)

This patch addresses an issue involving the binding of check constraints
in queries which use the "where current of" construction to refer to the
current row of an open cursor. The update statement was failing with a
"column not found" error, complaining about the column referred to by the
check constraint.

The problem arises in the processing of ResultColumnList.expandToAll, which
is used to construct ResultColumn instances for the columns in the table;
these result column instances are then used when the check constraint
is bound. ResultColumnList.java was constructing the ResultColumn instances
as unnamed, which caused an internal name "SQLCOL1" to be generated, which
later then caused the check constraint binding to fail.

The solution is simply to ensure that the ResultColumn references that are
built by expandToAll are named according to the column names.

The patch also adds several new test cases.
