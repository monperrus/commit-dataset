<D:comment>DERBY-3823 NullPointerException in stress.multi test

backported change #1242007 from 10.8 branch to 10.7 branch

This patch fixes a race condition in
EmbedPreparedStatement#getMetaData: if we are trying to retrieve the
metadata for a prepared statement while it is being recompiled there
is a time window during which the activation class is null. The
existing code could therefore cause an NPE. The new code plugs the
race condition. This NPE led to intermittent errors in
stressTestMulti.
