<D:comment>DERBY-2805: Fix FromVTI to not throw an ASSERT when sort elimination occurs.
In particular this patch does the following:

  1 - Renames the "markOrderingDependent()" method and related variables to
      reflect their use, which is to indicate that the optimizer has eliminated
      a sort and thus that the underlying result sets *may* need to make
      adjustments to compensate for the dropped sort.  At the moment the only
      result set node which needs to make such an adjustment is
      IndexRowToBaseRowNode.

  2 - Updates comments where appropriate to more explicitly describe the
      intended use of the "adjustForSortElimination()" method (which is
      what "markOrderingDependent()" was renamed to).

  3 - Adds a void implementation of "adjustForSortElimination()" to the
      FromVTI class since that class doesn't need to make any adjustments.
      This void method is what solves the failure reported in DERBY-2805.

  4 - Adds appropriate test cases to a new fixture in the existing
      lang/SysDiagVTIMappingTest JUnit test.
