<D:comment>DERBY-5284 A derby crash at exactly right time during a btree split can cause a
corrupt db which can not be booted.

backport fix from trunk to 10.6 branch.  clean merge.

Fixed a problem during BTREE split.  The first phase of btree split sees
if it can reclaim space from committed deleted rows.  If it finds any
it purges these rows in a nested internal transaction.  It needs to hold
the latch on the page until end of transaction, but did not.  This allowed
a very small window of a few instructions where another insert could use
the space on the page and then a system crash could cause the purges to undo
but fail due to the insert.

The fix was to hold the latch and let commit release it.
