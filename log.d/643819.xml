<D:comment>DERBY-3571: LOB locators are not released if the LOB columns are not accessed by the client.
Added a release mechanism for LOBs. The client will keep track of locators and release them when the result set position is changed, or the result set closed. Locators are released one by one with individual stored procedure calls. This is rather ineffective and should be optimized (for instance by piggybacking).
Also enabled a new test as part of the derbynet suite.
