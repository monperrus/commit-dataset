<D:comment>fix of DERBY-562, committing patch for: Sunitha Kambhampati

 This patch
 - changes the error message thrown when the stream is either less or greater than the requested length to
 'Input stream did not have exact amount of data as the requested length.'
 - enhances the characterStreams.out test, to print out the nested sql exceptions to ensure that the proper error message is returned.
 - updates to the master files.

 I verified that we are testing for these two error cases (ie stream has less or more data than requested length), for the following supported stream related api - setCharacterStream, setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream on PreparedStatement. Derby does not support setUnicodeStream api that is deprecated in jdbc 3.0.
