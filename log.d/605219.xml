<D:comment>DERBY-3037 

Migrating change 604976 from trunk into 10.3.2.2 codeline. The commit comment for trunk were as follows

EmbedStatement.executeStatement at line 1276 was calling finish rather than close on the Language Resultset. I fixed that to make a call to close. In addition, I also had to move the code for collecting the stats from finish to close method in NoRowsResultSetImpl.
