<D:comment>Derby-127: Handle the case of select statements that use a correlation names
   in the select list, a group by clause, and an order by clause that refers
   to a column by its database name instead of its correlation name. (Eg:
   select c1 as x from t where ... group by x order by c1)
Derby currently throws an exception with SQLState 42x04.
