<D:comment>DERBY-2256: Make sure that IN-list comparisons are done with the "dominant" type
when two values have different type precedences. More specifically:

  - When determining the "judge" type in InListOperatorNode.preprocess(),
    iterate through all of the values to find out what the dominant type is,
    and then use that as the "judge" for sorting. Prior to these changes we
    just used the type of the left operand as judge, but that was not correct.

  - At execution time (i.e. in DataType.in()), add logic to ensure that all search
    comparisons are done using the dominant type of the values being compared.

  - Add appropriate test cases to lang/inbetween.sql.
