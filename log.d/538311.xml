<D:comment>DERBY-2618 (partial) Make ClobAsciiStream honour the contract for OutputStream.write(int) by ignoring
top 24 bits. Optimize ClobAsciiStream by re-using an array rather than recreating one for each write(byte[]) call.
Fix ClobStreamControl to correctly process a Derby UTF8 encoded stream.
Does not fix the issue, fixes are being worked on by others under related bugs.</D:comment>
