backporting 535466 change from trunk to 10.2.

Upgrade of 10.0 to 10.3 was failing because system procedures were being
created, and as part of the creation some updates were attempted to catalogs
that were not created yet. Fixed in full upgrade by first creating the
new system catalogs and then creating the procedures.
