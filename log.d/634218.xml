<D:comment>DERBY-3358: After an incorrect(unsuccesfull) startMaster comand, further correct startMaster attempts also fail.
Contributed by V Narayanan.
M java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/replication/master/MasterController.java
* Added a variable boolean that indicates whether the master controller is currently running or has
  been stopped. I thought I could manage with the earlier boolean variable stopMasterController but
  decided against it because it seemed more tied with the stopMaster operation.
* moved start up parameter initialization from boot to startMaster method. 
* changed the startMaster, stopMaster and the startFailover methods to take into account the boolean
  active.
* replaced the earlier uses of stopMasterController with active.
  
M java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/RawStore.java
* The replication properties that are part of the bootServiceModule call no longer contain the
  startup parameters. These have instead been moved to the startMaster method.
* The replicationProps are empty and not null because a null passed to a bootServiceModule call
  results in a NullPointerException.

M java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/replication/master/MasterFactory.java
* Changed the startMaster declaration to now accept the startup parameters as the method arguments.

M java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.xml
M java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/reference/SQLState.java
* Added a new messages for the case when the master has already been booted.
