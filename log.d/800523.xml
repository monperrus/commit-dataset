<D:comment>DERBY-4310 jdbcapi.XATest passes but shows Table/View 'APP.FOO' does not exist. under logs/serverConsoleOutput.log

DERBY-4155 jdbcapi/XATest.java doesn't seem to be running anywhere

The problem was actually an embedded issue that close() tried to reprepare the statement which would fail if dependencies had been dropped.  This caused a failur in proper shutdown of network server which could cause a hang after running  XATest.
