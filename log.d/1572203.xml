DERBY-5416: SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE causes an OutOfMemoryError when the
heap is full at call time and then gets mostly garbage collected later
on.

backporting change #1550103 from trunk to 10.10.

Improve the accuracy of the code that estimates the memory requirement
of the sort buffer. When it detects that the current memory usage is
lower than the initial memory usage, it now records the current usage
and uses that value instead of the initial memory usage in future
calculations.

This compensates to some degree, but not fully, for the skew in the
estimates due to garbage collection happening after the initial memory
usage. The memory requirement will not be as badly underestimated, and
the likelihood of OutOfMemoryErrors is reduced.

There is no regression test case for this bug, since the only
reliable, reproducible test case that we currently have, needs too
much time, disk space and memory to be included in the regression test
suite.
