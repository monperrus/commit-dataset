<D:comment>DERBY-395  Server-side "trace on" and "trace off" commands do not appear to be working correctly.

Contributed by Bryan Pendleton

Attached is a proposed fix. derbyall passed. I put a small comment in the code. I didn't add any new tests, which is unfortunate, but I didn't have any brilliant inside about an easy way to add such tests. Testing with the server tracing is already somewhat of a PITA because the server tracing interacts poorly with things like the security manager.
