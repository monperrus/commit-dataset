<D:comment>DERBY-1148 Client XA getTransactionIsolation() does not return the correct isolation level when rejoining a global transaction

Contributed by Deepa Remesh

Summary of patch:

* Changes getTransactionIsolation method in org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection class to get the isolation level from server. The built-in function "CURRENT ISOLATION" is used for this. It throws SQLException in case of failures. At the start of the method, the current auto-commit value is stored in a variable. When executing the function, auto-commit is set to false. At the end of the method, auto-commit value is restored. As it is the client which drives the auto-commit, this strategy of locally changing the auto-commit works.

* Removes the excludes for DERBY-1148 and DERBY-1035 from checkDataSource test. Adds a test for transaction suspend/resume in checkDataSource test. Updates master files

With this patch, I have run derbynetclientmats with Sun jdk 1.4.2 on Windows XP. I also ran checkDataSource.java and checkDataSource30.java with embedded and client framework. No failures
