<D:comment>DERBY-3889: LOBStreamControl.truncate() doesn't delete temporary files

Created helper method for closing and deleting temporary files to make
it less likely that some of the required operations are
forgotten. Also moved the lobFile field into the LOBFile class to
reduce the risk of getting inconsistencies between the fields tmpFile
and lobFile.
