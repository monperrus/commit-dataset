<D:comment>Merging revision 553834 from main into Derby 10.3.1.1 codeline. commit comments are as follows

DERBY-2725 

If both the character string operands involved in DataTypeDescriptor.comparable() have collation derivation of NONE, then 
such 2 DTDs can't be compared. I am adding code to implement that behavior and added a test case for this.
