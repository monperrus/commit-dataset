<D:comment>DERBY-304 submitted on behalf of Suresh Thalamati
Fix :

1) Do not allow backup path to be any derby database directory. A directory is
assumed to be a derby database directory if it has service.properties file in it.

2) copy files needed from the database home into the backup one by one
instead of recursive copy from the top directory.

3) while copying the directories under jar directory, copy each sub directory
separately without copying any subdirectories under them (There should not
be any unless if user has created explicitly or created backup at that location).

4) Log and Seg0 directory are NOT already copied recursively, this was changed as part of
online backup work (DERBY-239).
