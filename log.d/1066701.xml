<D:comment>DERBY-4741 Make embedded Derby work reliably in the presence of thread interrupts

Patch derby-4741-testQueryInterrupt. 

* adds a new test case: InterruptResilienceTest#testLongQueryInterrupt
  which tests that a query will check for the interrupt flag and throw
  08000 (CONN_INTERRUPT) at the same time is checks for query
  time-out.

* adds a missing piece of code in InterruptStatus#throwIf

* I also adjusted an existing test (for RAF recovery) to handle the
  case that we could see 08000 (CONN_INTERRUPT) when performing a
  query as part of that test, depending on when the interrupt happens.
