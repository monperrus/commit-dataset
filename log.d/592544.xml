<D:comment>DERBY-3178
This commit modifies DataSourceTest.java to ensure that expected Connection events are fired to the 
ConnectionEventListener.
The changes have been implemented by having AssertEventCatcher in DataSourceTest.java keep track of what events 
it received. This state is kept in boolean gotConnectionClosed and boolean gotConnectionErrorOccured flags in
AssertEventCatcher. The test then checks the state of AssertEventCatcher after the test has done firing the events
to make sure AssertEventCatcher got the expected events.
