<D:comment>fix timing problem between compress deallocation of pages and background
post commit, locking for heap container for truncate was wrong.  Also 
change compress of alloc page to be a logged operation.  I thought it 
could be handled unlogged, similar to preallocation - but there were some
crash cases that would not be handled correctly if it were not logged.
