<D:comment>DERBY-4053 Migrating changes from trunk(revision 793588) into 10.5 codeline. Commit
comments for trunk checkin were as follows
************** 
DERBY-4053 The local XA connections were not getting rollback during Database close and 
this resulted into exception at connection close if the connection object had any pending 
transaction. Made changes so that all the connections(except global XA connections) will 
have their transactions rolled back before those connections are closed.
