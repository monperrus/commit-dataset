<D:comment>Derby-194: Modify Derby metadata for datetime values so that the correct "precision" and "scale" for those types will be returned in metadata calls.

Description from Army:

Since the definitions of "precision" and "scale" aren't clearly defined for datetime values in JDBC, I've set them based on the ODBC specification.  It was agreed in discussion of this issue (and also of DERBY-319) that the "intent" of JDBC for these values is to mimic ODBC behavior.  See the thread here for that discussion:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.db.derby.devel/2786
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.db.derby.devel/2787

So that said, the attached patch sets precision/scale for datetime values according to the following ODBC pages:

[ Precision ]

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/odbc/htm/odbccolumn_size.asp

Pasted from the above link:

"The column (or parameter) size of numeric data types is defined as the maximum number of digits used by the data type of the column or parameter, or the precision of the data. For character types, this is the length in characters of the data; for binary data types, column size is defined as the length in bytes of the data. For the time, timestamp, and all interval data types, this is the number of characters in the character representation of this data."

[ Scale ]

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/odbc/htm/odbcdecimal_digits.asp

Pasted from the above link:

"The decimal digits of decimal and numeric data types is defined as the maximum number of digits to the right of the decimal point, or the scale of the data. For approximate floating-point number columns or parameters, the scale is undefined because the number of digits to the right of the decimal point is not fixed. For datetime or interval data that contains a seconds component, the decimal digits is defined as the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the seconds component of the data."

I have run "derbyall" on Windows 2000 with Sun JDK 1.4.2 and have included all required master updates in the patch.  The "svn stat" output is attached to this email, along with the patch itself.
