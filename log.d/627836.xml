<D:comment>DERBY-3299 (incremental: Changes/additions to CreateIndexConstantAction.java
so that it can support the creation of "replacement" conglomerates, which
will be necessary when the physical conglomerate for an index has been
dropped but the index descriptor still exists.  This can happen if multiple
indexes share a physical conglomerate but then the conglomerate is dropped
as part of "drop index" processing for one of the indexes. (Note that
"indexes" here includes indexes which were created to back constraints).
In that case we'll need to create a new "replacement" physical conglomerate
to support the existing descriptor.
