<D:comment>DERBY-4245: Sorting a table containing a CLOB fails after upgrade to 10.5.
Changed the mechanisms used to "unread" surplus bytes from the source stream.
The order is now:
 1) Use InputStream.mark/reset if available.
 2) Create a PushbackInputStream and associate it with the source stream if the
    the source stream is a FormatIdInputStream.
 3) Try using the Resetable interface.
Note that as part of this fix, mark/reset was disabled for LimitInputStream.

Reading too many bytes will only happen in 10.5 (and later) when an old-style
Clob representation is processed. Note that since the header format of existing
Clob values isn't changed as part of the upgrade logic, the situation may arise
in later versions as well if the database has been upgraded from 10.4 or
earlier versions.
