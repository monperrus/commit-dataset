<D:comment>DERBY-2422 ; test holdCursorJavaReflection was decided as unnecessary with
  jdk1.4 and up as it only tests a different way to get at the holdability
  functionality (as a temporary workaround while jdk13 was still supported). 
  However, there was no specific derby functionality tested that isn't tested
  elsewhere and the test should've gotten deleted to prevent confusion later.
