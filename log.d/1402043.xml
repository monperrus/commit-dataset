<D:comment>DERBY-4323: test failure in lang.ErrorMessageTest with IBM iseries IBM 1.5

Make the two threads that race for locks do as little as possible in order
to reduce the risk of missing the two-second window for constructing the
deadlock. That is, move query compilation and thread startup out so that
the participating threads only perform query execution.</D:comment>
