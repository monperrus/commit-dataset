<D:comment>DERBY-337: Enhance dblook to support SQL functions.

1 - Renames "impl/tools/dblook/DB_StoredProcedure.java" to "impl/tools/dblook/DB_Alias.java" because that file now handles stored procedures AND functions AND synonyms, all of which are based on the SYSALIASES system catalog.

2 - Adds logic to new DB_Alias.java file to generate DDL for functions.

3 - Modifies the "toString()" method of the catalog/types/RoutineAliasInfo file to generate a string that is SYNTACTICALLY VALID based on whether an instance of that class is for a PROCEDURE or for a FUNCTION.  The reason this change is required is because the "ALIASINFO" column that is returned as part of the SYS.SYSALIASES result set is an instance of RoutineAliasInfo, and thus a call to ResultSet.getString() on the ALIASINFO column ultimately makes a call to RoutineAliasInfo.toString().  That said, the dblook utility makes a "getString()" call on the ALIASINFO column and uses the result to generate the corresponding DDL.  Before this patch, the result of the toString() method always corresponded to the PROCEDURE syntax; but now, since dblook is generating DDL for FUNCTIONs, the RoutineAliasInfo.toString() method must recognize if an instance is a PROCEDURE or FUNCTION and return the appropriate syntax.

4 - Adds test cases for FUNCTIONS to the dblook tests and updates the master files accordingly.
