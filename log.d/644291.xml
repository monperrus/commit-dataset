<D:comment>DERBY-3509: The replication log shipper is not notified when a new replication transmitter is instantiated in MC#handleException.
 - Modified the handleException method to return the transmitter object that is created.
 - The log shipper bases its decision on whether it should continue with the log shipping based on if a valid transmitter object is created.
