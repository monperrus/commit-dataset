This patch (derby-709_latest.diff) fixes the problems appreared with earlier
patch when tests are run againest JARS.

a canonical path.
--- Modified the deryb_tests.plocy to allow deltes in
${user.dir}${/}extinout${/}- .,
It is needed because, backup tests deletes the old copy of the backup at the
backup location.
--- set noSecurityManager = true for the tests that can not be run under
security manager due to bug : 1066
--- changes st_1 properties to use external tests dirs , so that tests does not
required "user.dir" permission to create parent directories for the backup
paths.
