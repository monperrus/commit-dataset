<D:comment>DERBY-4741 Make Derby work reliably in the presence of thread interrupts

Patch derby-4741-sleeps-waits-3, which modifies all actions when
seeing interrupt in Object#wait and Thread#sleep inside
"org.apache.derby.impl.store.*" as well as in one other instance.

Thew new code just makes a note that an interrupt occured and then
retry. The old code sometimes threw 08000 (CONN_INTERRUPT) or just
ignored the interrupts.
