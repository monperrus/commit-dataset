<D:comment>DERBY-1386: Wrong results with query using LIKE and ESCAPE clause that
includes "%", "\", and "_"

Queries using LIKE/ESCAPE could return wrong results if the first
wildcard character was preceded by an even number of escape
characters. This patch fixes the issue by changing the way
Like.lessThanString() parses the pattern string.
