<D:comment>DERBY-4471 Left outer join reassociation rewrite gives wrong result

Merged back to 10.6 branch as
svn merge -c 990292 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk

Patch derby-4471-1d. This patch changes logic for determining if right
deep nested (left) outer join can reassiciated to left deep, i.e.

   OJ1                        OJ1
  /  \                        / \
 /    \                      /   t3
t1    OJ2          =&gt;       /
      /  \                 OJ2
     /    \               /   \
    t2    t3           t1     t2 

The old behavior was both too liberal (this issue showed a query being
reordered erroneously), and too restrictive. The patch removes the
"too liberal" hole, and also opens up for some new valid cases.

For further details, refer to the JIRA issue and the code comments
especially the javadoc for the methods HalfOuterJoinNode#LOJ_reorderable and
HalfOuterJoinNode#isNullRejecting.

As a part of the patch, the old harness based test lojreorder.sql has been converted
into the JUnit based LojReorderTest equivalent.

For further details, refer to the JIRA issue and the code comments.
