<D:comment>DERBY-1772
contributed by Army Brown

Attaching the simplest patch possible for this issue--just changes SQLSTATE '42Z78' to a Derby-specific SQLSTATE, 'XML00'. I also moved SQLSTATE '42Z7Z' to 'XML01' since I believe it falls into the same category of "Derby-specific errors that are not covered by the SQLStandard."

I read through the SQL standard definitions for SQLSTATES and none of them jumped out at me as being more appropriate than '42', so I just created a new set of SQLSTATEs, "XMLxx", for this particular issue. As I said, this was just the easiest way to go; if anyone can suggest a better SQLSTATE to fit the errors, please let me know. Otherwise, the d1772_v1.patch should be all it takes to resolve this issue.

Note: Since we don't currently have any tests for cases where the classpath is missing the required Xalan/JAXP classes, there were no test/master files to update. The need to add tests for such scenarios is filed as part of DERBY-1758.
