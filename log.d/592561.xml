<D:comment>Migrating changes from trunk(revision r592544) into 10.3 codeline. The commit comments for main were as follows
DERBY-3178
This commit modifies DataSourceTest.java to ensure that expected Connection events are fired to the
ConnectionEventListener.
The changes have been implemented by having AssertEventCatcher in DataSourceTest.java keep track of what events
it received. This state is kept in boolean gotConnectionClosed and boolean gotConnectionErrorOccured flags in
AssertEventCatcher. The test then checks the state of AssertEventCatcher after the test has done firing the events
to make sure AssertEventCatcher got the expected events.
