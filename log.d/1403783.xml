<D:comment>Bundles as directories. New installed location syntax.

Support was added for installing bundles as directories to compliment already existing support for subsystems as directories.
Directory names representing bundles must end with ".jar".

The generated location used for installing embedded subsystems and bundles now uses the following pattern:

&lt;provision-to subsystem location&gt;!/&lt;resource location&gt;

The format should be interpreted as "there is an entry for a resource located at &lt;resource location&gt; within the subsystem
archive located at &lt;provision-to subsystem location&gt;." Typically, &lt;resource location&gt; will be a file name. The syntax is
intended to support the loose config scenario introduced with the idirfinder URL scheme.

Also fixed a few compile warnings in some test classes.</D:comment>
