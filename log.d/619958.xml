<D:comment>Merging changes 618788, 619279 and 619772 into 10.3 codeline for DERBY-3304.

For reference, copying the commit comments for each of these revisions that are getting merged into 10.3 codeline

*********commit comments for 619772****************
DERBY-3304
Some code cleanup in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.endTransactionActivationHandling so the code is more readable.
No functionality change, just consolidated various if statements and used some local variables to replace repeated
method calls like a.getResultSet() and a.getResultSet().returnsRows()

*********commit comments for 619279****************
This is a followup commit for DERBY-3304 based on various comments. It does following
1)The existing method resetActivations in GenericLanguageConnectionContext has been renamed to better reflect it's
functionality. It will be now called endTransactionActivationHandling since it gets called for commit/rollback.
2)The javadoc comments for resetActivations(now called endTransactionActivationHandling) were not valid. Fixed that in
this commit.
3)Took out the redundant code about setting the holdability to false if we were in rollback. It was needed earlier
because the method that took care of activations at rollback time needed to check the holdability. That method
(BaseActivation.reset) does not check holdability anymore and hence we do not need to set the activations to false
holdability when we are dealing with rollback.
4)Lastly, JDBC api for Connection.commit does not ask for clearing of warnings and hence we should not have code to
clear the warnings at the time of commit. I removed the warning clearing code from resetActivations(now called
endTransactionActivationHandling) in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.

*********commit comments for 618788****************
DERBY-3304
This commit addresses two issues.
First of all, it cleanups up reset method in BaseActivation which was doing more than just bringing the Activation back 
to pre-execution state. The method had to make itself aware of holdability and what kind of resultset it was dealing with
before closing or clearing the row of the resultset. The reason for this behavior is commit code path was relying on
Activation.reset to do more than just bringing the activation to pre-execution state. I fixed this by moving this code
from BaseActivation.reset to GenericLanguageConnectionContext.resetActivations.

Additionally, in the new code in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.resetActivations, I added the code to not close the
language result sets associated with activations that do not return rows even if activation may have holdability set to
false. This will ensure that a commit inside a java procedure will not inadvertantly close the resultset associated with
the java procedure call.

Additionally, I copied some of the cleanup work(as shown below) from BaseActivation.reset into
new code in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.resetActivations
   a.clearHeapConglomerateController();
   if (!a.isSingleExecution())
      a.clearWarnings();

This code above was always getting executed at the time of commit before my commit and because of that, I decided to copy
it in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.resetActivations. If anyone has any comments on this, please let me know.
