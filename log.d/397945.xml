<D:comment>DERBY-616

backporting fix for DERBY-616 (svn 384282) from trunk into 10.1 branch, 
targeted for upcoming 10.1.3 release.

original notes for fix:

o Added a missing privileged blocks for I/O call in StreamFileContainer.java ,
this class is used by the sort during index creation ..etc.

o Enabled some of the tests which were not running under security manager
earlier because of this bug to run by default with security manager.

o removed the additional permissions from the derby test policy file
 that were added earlier to avoid this bug for some test cases.
