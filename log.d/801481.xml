<D:comment>DERBY-4331

Fixes a number of sort avoidance bugs that were introduced by the fix 
for DERBY-3926.  This check in backs out the equi-join part of the DERBY-3926.  
The changes for this were isolated and were the only changes to 
FromBaseTable.java.  Backing out only this part of the 3926 checkin fixes new 
problems identified in DERBY-4331, and continues to fix the problem queries in 
DERBY-3926.  Knowledge of equijoin is no longer used as a factor for 
sort avoidance.

Also included is an update to the wisconsin tests.  A number of diffs 
resulted from different join order to maintain a sort avoidance plan.  2 
queries identified in DERBY-4339 no longer use sort avoidance.

The new test cases were reported as part of 4331 were added to the
OrderByAndSortAvoidance test.
