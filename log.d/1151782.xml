<D:comment>Fix building test-frameworks from contribs/modules: The classpath used during compilation did not include ANT when executed from modules or contribs, so the build failed. Now the test-framework gets its own compilation classpath, the ant.jar can even be removed completely from top-level.</D:comment>
