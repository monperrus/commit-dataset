<D:comment>DERBY-4425: NPE with INSERT .. SELECT .. UNION and generated expressions

This patch adds a test which confirms that DERBY-4425 is fixed. The code
change which resolved DERBY-4425 was performed as part of fixing DERBY-4419,
since the same code change fixes both symptoms, so this is a test-only patch.

subversion revision 831304 contains the DERBY-4419 code change.
