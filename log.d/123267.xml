<D:comment>committing patch to fix DERBY-94 submitted by Suresh Thalamati (tsuresh@Source-Zone.org)
Problem:
Container group level locks were not getting released when lock is
escalated to table level exclusive lock. Locks were not getting released
even on commit/close of cursor   because once escalation process
acquires table level X lock successfully, container group lock policy is
set as NO-LOCKING state.

Fix:
Attached Fix releases the container group level locks before setting
lock policy to  NO LOCKING mode when a table level X lock is acquired
because of escalation.
