<D:comment>Minor improvements in OE test framework.
  - Add a Submitter that executes using multiple threads
  - Add a clear counts method to the Submitter and when reporting only print transaction counts for those transactions that were executed.
  - Fix same bug in Standard transaction implementation for payment and order status by name where the incorrect customer was selected.</D:comment>
