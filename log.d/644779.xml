<D:comment>Migrating revision 643292 for DERBY-3320 from trunk into 10.4 codeline. Following is a brief
description of changes. More can be found by checking the commit comments for 643292.

DERBY-3320 This commit will ensure that if the Collator support does not exist during
a territory based database creation, then we will throw an exception saying Collator
support does not exist. In case of subsequent boot of a successfully created territory
based database, we will check for the Collator support from JVM at the time first collation
related operation is run on the database. This can happen if the database recovery needs
to be done at the boot time or it can happen after the database has booted and user has
issued a SQL which requires Collator support.
