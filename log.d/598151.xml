merge fixes from trunk to 10.3

If btree post commit thread can not get table level lock for row cleanup and
possible tree merging, then instead attempt just row level row purging.  Without
this change some stress tests were seeing post commit queue continuous grow
as there was always some thread with a lock on the index, and thus the items
could never get executed.
