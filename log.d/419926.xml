<D:comment>Adding a test to help debug DERBY-1248.  OnlineBackupTest5.sql is just 
a slight variation of OnlineBackupTest4.sql.  It does the same work but
restores the backup to a new place in extinout, rather than on top of
the original case.  Hopefully if this test reproduces DERBY-1248 the info
in the old db will help understand what is going on.  Also changed the 
assert to dump the full page.
