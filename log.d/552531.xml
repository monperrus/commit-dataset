<D:comment>DERBY-2879

Derby currently requires all the character columns in a table to have the same collation as the collation of the schema in
which the table is getting defined. In order to implement this behavior, CreateTableNods's bind method will check the
collation of it's character columns against the schema's collation and if there is a mismatch, an exception will be thrown.

In addition, this patch does minor cleanup. The string constants for the 2 collation types in Derby were declared in both
StringDataValue.java and Property.java I have removed it from StringDataValue so we don't have duplicate constants.
