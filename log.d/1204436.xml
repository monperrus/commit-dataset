<D:comment>Add new backwards tests from 3.5 release branch. Also added a temporary 3.5 lucene-core.jar file.

Once the release is out, changes to the backwards tests from the release branch will be merged to the backwards folder and the final/official JAR file is placed in lib folder. This also fixes the backwards compilation to respect new test-framework source layout.</D:comment>
