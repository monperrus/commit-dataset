<D:comment>DERBY-1910: OutOfMemoryError happens when jdbcapi/_Suite.junit was
executed as DerbyNetClient (in jvm1.4.2)

The problem was being caused by some of the tests that kept a
reference to a connection object which prevented this object from
being garbage collected. The attached patch (derby-1910.diff) fixes
that problem.

Patch contributed by Fernanda Pizzorno.
