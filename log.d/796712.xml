<D:comment>DERBY-4312 SQLException XJ215 on insert with setCharacterStream() and autocommit off in mailjdbc test

DERBY-4224 Commit after setAsciiStream() makes execution fail with the client driver

Use of a stream after performing commit was incorrectly causing an exception. Also fixes setBinaryStream();

merge revision 796020 from trunk.  Did not merge StreamingColumnTest changes since that test has not been converted in 10.4
