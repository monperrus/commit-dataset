<D:comment>Revert the revert of the revert. I hope Robert Muir will followup and we can agree that this patch is not really a good idea and we should discuss on LUCENE-4630 what to do. I know that Mike is already beasting J9, so we would need an option to disable this AssumptionFailedEx. Thanks in advance!</D:comment>
