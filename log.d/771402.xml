<D:comment>change Message body to byte[].  this reveals where there are problems: everything that is using any of the send messages already needs to be doing that or they're broken.  the good ones I just unwrap; the broken ones I fixed except for MoveMessage which doesn't even have a byte[] serializer yet, so I left that one broken.  writeResponseResolver is the specific case that caused the bug report.
