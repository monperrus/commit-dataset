<D:comment>DERBY-3766: EmbedBlob.setPosition is highly ineffective for streams.
 a) Removed the 'pos' and 'biStream' variables. A "global" Blob position is no longer maintained by EmbedBlob.
 b) Introduced 'streamPositionOffset' to account for the encoded length bytes. Only used when the Blob is represented by a store stream. Set to Integer.MIN_VALUE when unused. Otherwise, the offset is obtained in the constructor, where the Blob length is saved for later use as well if it is known (the stream is not skipped to find length).
 c) Removed 'BLOB_BUF_SIZE' and 'buf', they're no longer needed.
 d) Renamed 'setPosition' to 'setBlobPosition' and rewrote the method. The method now relies on PositionedStoreStream to do the repositioning. In some cases this will lead to using the same algorithm as earlier, otherwise it will be more effective because the stream isn't reset. Note the addition of 'streamPositionOffset' to the logical zero-based Blob position. Also note that another SQLState is used. The method also returns the new position (this is only for convenience).
 e) Changes in read(); added pos argument, don't throw SQLException, use the correct stream.
 f) Updated length() to reflect changes.
 g) Rewrote the two 'position' methods to maintain a local position variable. Also removed special handling for the BLOB_LENGTH_TOO_LONG exception.
 h) Updated JavaDoc and added position argument for the two 'checkMatch' methods.
 i) Added one new test in BlobClob4BlobTest.
