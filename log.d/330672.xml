<D:comment>DERBY-675: The "readLine" method in ODBCMetadataGenerator.java was treating
single backslashes as "end-of-line" markers and hence was not recognizing
escaped sequences like "\n".  It turns out that the check for backslashes in
that method is unnecessary, so this patch removes it.  I ran the metadata.java
and odbc_metadata.java tests with this patch and they ran okay, so I think it 
should be safe.  I still want to run some more tests tonight, just to be sure,
but I thought I'd post the patch now since it is affecting another developer's
current work (Mamta's).
