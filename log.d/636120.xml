<D:comment>checking in fixes to allow a 50 user by 59 minute configuration of the
stress test to be run.  I ran this once so far on a 4 way, XP box and it
passed.  In the past this test has sometimes found bugs that the shorter
and less users stress test did not uncover - I seem to remember it mostly
being useful for statement cache issues.  Note on my machine each run
eats up around 11 gig - mostly from the .out files of each of the test runners.
