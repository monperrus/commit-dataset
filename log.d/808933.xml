<D:comment>DERBY-4053

Backporting changes into 10.4 codeline. Had to do some manual conflict resolution. In 
addition, needed to manually copy following method into EmbedXAConnection which was getting
used by changes for DERBY-4053. Following method was added as part of DERBY-3319

+    /** 
+     * Check if this connection is part of a global XA transaction. 
+     * 
+     * @return {@code true} if the transaction is global, {@code false} if the 
+     * transaction is local 
+     */ 
+    private boolean isGlobal() { 
+        return xaRes.getCurrentXid () != null; 
+    } 
+
