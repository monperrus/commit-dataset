<D:comment>Merging fix for DERBY-2960 from main (revision 558036) into 10.3 codeline. The commit comments were as follows

"select" query failed because we were generating SQLVarchar rather than CollatorSQLVarchar
create table alltypes (c char(10), v varchar(50));
insert into alltypes values ('duplicate', 'is duplicated');
select substr(c||v, 1, 4), count(*) from alltypes group by substr(c||v, 1, 4) ;

To fix the problem, I needed to override StringDataValue getNewVarchar() in CollatorSQLVarchar. Without this new method, we were generating SQLVarchar in territory based databased when the collation type was territory based.
