<D:comment>DERBY-5090: Retrieving BLOB fields sometimes fails

Make Derby close open streams obtained from the result set when the next
get-call is invoked (as dictated by JDBC standard). This was done for some
streams, but not all. What happened was also different for the client and the
embedded driver.
Added CloseFilterInputStream (modeled after existing class in the client).
Removed NewByteArrayInputStream, used Java API class instead.
