<D:comment>Remove the Dependent.makeValid() call. No calls are made to makeValid() through this interface.
Can be seen by the fact that most of the implementations are empty and not covered by the
code covergae with the tests, as well as there is no path to them. The one version
that was called was for GenericPreparedStatement in CurrentOfNode, but a better method
is the rePrepare() method on PreparedStatement.
Related to DERBY-2380.
