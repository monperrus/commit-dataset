<D:comment>DERBY-4040: SQLChar.getLength returns wrong length for some data values.
When asked to return the character length of a SQLChar or SQLVarchar and
the value is represented as a stream, skip the two header bytes and then
decode the whole stream. The cause of the bug being fixed, was that the
byte length was used as the character length.
