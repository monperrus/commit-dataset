<D:comment>Patch to not attempt to reload the security policy if no security manager is installed by
the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_RELOAD_SECURITY_POLICY procedure.
Also cleanup the procedure implementation to be self contained by using an anonymous inner
class for the privilege block. This removes a security hole where other code could use the
previous public class to perform policy refreshes. Also fix the exception handling to correctly
catch SecurityException, previously the code only caught checked exceptions which are not thrown
by Policy.getPolicy().refresh().</D:comment>
