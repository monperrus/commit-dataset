<D:comment>DERBY-3304

The main purpose of this patch is to fix the rollback handling for resultsets that do not
return rows. An example case for this is a java procedure which has a Connection.rollback 
inside it. When the user calls the java procedure, and Connection.rollback is made inside 
of it, Derby should not be closing the resultset assoicated with the java procedure call 
(that resultset is a CallStatementResultSet). In other words, a user initiated rollback 
through JDBC Connection object should leave the resultsets that do not return rows open. In 
order to implement this, I had to make changes to ignore resultsets that do not return rows 
in 
GenericLanguageConnectionContext.endTransactionActivationHandling. As a result of this
change, for the eg case given above, the activation assoicated with the java procedure
will not be reset (which also means that, CallStatementResultSet.close will not be called)
inside GenericLanguageConnectionContext.endTransactionActivationHandling. 

But the code inside CallStatementResultset.close() took care of the closed dynamic resultset
and it took out the closed dynamic resultset from the list of resultsets that would be
available to user through the Statement.getResultSet api. With my changes through this
patch, we are going to skip the CallStatementResultset.close during
GenericLanguageConnectionContext.endTransactionActivationHandling which means that we have
to deal with those closed dynamic resultsets on our own. I did that part of logic 
changes in EmbedStatement.processDynamicResults

EmbedStatement.processDynamicResults used to check if the JDBC Resultset is closed by
directly checking the field isClosed in the EmbedResultSet. But it is not sufficient to
check only JDBC Resultset. We need to check the underlying language Resultset too to
determine if the dynamic resultset is closed. There is no direct api on EmbedResultset 
which will return a boolean after checking the JDBC Resultset and language Resulset. Instead,
there is a method called EmbedResultSet.checkIfClosed. This method will throw an exception
if it finds the JDBC ResultSet or language ResultSet closed. So, my changes in 
EmbedStatement.processDynamicResults make a call to EmbedResultSet.checkIfClosed and if 
there is an exception thrown, then we know that the resultset is closed and hence we should
move to the next resultset. 

In addition to these code changes, I have added a new test to LangProcedureTest. The new
java procedure is defined to return 2 dynamic resultsets. One of these resultsets is 
created before Connection.rollback inside the java procedure. The other dynamic resultset
is created after Connection.rollback. As as result of Connection.rollback, the first
dynamic resultset will be closed but the second one will remain open. The test makes sure
that only one dynamic resultset is returned by the java procedure.

Also, made one minor change in LangProcedureTest for an existing test. The test at line 804 
was getting a resultset from the Statement object without asserting that there are no more
resultsets. The resultset object would have been null anyways in this test because there
are no open resulsets from the Java procedure. Because of this, I took out the redundant
code of getting null resultset object from Statement using getResultset,
