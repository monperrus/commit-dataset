<D:comment>DERBY-4500 setNetworkClientCP should use return, not exit, on error

backported change #895666 from trunk to 10.5 branch.

Since the setNetworkClientCP and setNetworkServerCP scripts are designed
to be called from another script, or sourced from the shell, they should
use 'return' rather than 'exit', to report an error.

This change was contributed by John Storta, Jr. (js at storta dot net).
