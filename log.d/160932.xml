<D:comment>Derby-176 (partial)
Reduce the number of code instructions generated for a putField() followed by an endStatement()
by providing a setField() method that sets a field with the top value of the stack but does not
leave the field's contents on the stack. The use of putField() mimicing the Java language field=value;
lead to many cases where the value on the stack was not required and immediately popped using endStatement().
This lead to two extra instructions per field assignment (dup and pop), providing a setField() removes the
need for the endStatement() as it never performs the dup.
