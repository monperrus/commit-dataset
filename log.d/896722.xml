<D:comment>DERBY-4110: Deleting from a table with its synonym throws an exception

When building the ResultColumnList that is used to tie together the
search results from the WHERE clause with the processing of the DELETE,
the result columns will be bound against the exposed table name of the
table named in the DELETE statement, so if the statement used a
synonymTableName, then the result column list should manufacture column
references which use a synonymTableName as well.
