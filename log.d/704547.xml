<D:comment>DERBY-3825: StoreStreamClob.getReader(charPos) performs poorly.
Added repositioning functionality to UTF8Reader - ordered after increasing cost:
 a) Reposition within current character buffer (small hops forwards and potentially backwards - in range 1 char to 8K chars)
 b) Forward stream from current position (hops forwards)
 c) Reset stream and skip data (hops backwards) 
In addition the new method getInternalReader was added to InternalClob. It takes advantage of the repositioning capability of UTF8Reader.
Clob.getSubString uses the new functionality when the Clob is represented by a StoreStreamClob.
Previously only mechanism c) was used.
