<D:comment>DERBY-2036 DERBY-2043 DERBY-2047 (partial) Re-work connection handling in JUnit tests.
Create connection factory Connector with two implementations, DataSourceConnector and DriverManagerConnector.
This ensures that running tests does not attempt to load DriverManager when running tests with JSR169.
Ensure DataSource implementation sets user name and password from configuration for the getConnection()
method to ensure the ChangerUserTestSetup works.
Refactor the setting of data source Java bean properties to be from a HashMap rather than a Properties
object to ensure that no special code exists at the lowest level to deal with different property types.</D:comment>
