<D:comment>DERBY-4279: Statement cache deadlock 

Modified ResultColumnList.generateHolderMethod to only take a lock when
obtaining row template(s) if the data dictionary is in DDL_MODE. The lock that
used to be obtained was a CIS lock/latch.
The purpose of this change is to avoid the deadlocks that have been observed in
some scenarios when statements are being compiled or recompiled.
