<D:comment>DERBY-2687 store/encryptDatabase.sql fails intermittently with ClassNotFoundException, Log Corrupted

Patch derby-2687-2 + removed an additional unused line. This converts
encryptDatabase.sql to JUnit and also makes the test ignore a hash
collision case: the stored two byte digest of the secret key can in can
1/2**16 cases match the the digest of bogus key gotten by decoding the
encrypted key using the wrong bootpassword, thus allowing boot to
proceed using a wrong encryption key, leading to a boot crash (the
"boot issue").

Another issue (less likely) can still make the test fail (the
"bootpassword change issue"), but cf. the improvement issue DERBY-5622
which would resolve that.
