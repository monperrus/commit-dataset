<D:comment>DERBY-213 - ResultSet.next() after last row of FORWARD_ONLY cursor throws an SQL Exception with Network Server

- Additional tests in jdbcapi/resultset.java
- Change to special flag to fix a small NullPointerException
- modified output files for resultset.out, updatableResultSet.out, holdCursorJDBC30, forupdate.out
- Changes to ResultSet, Statement and Connection in the org.apache.derby.client.am package. These changes have the following effects:
      * FORWARD_ONLY ResultSets will no longer close implicitly after the last ResultSet has been retrieved.
      * Checks to see if an auto-commit should be performed have been moved to Statement to mimic embedded functionality.
      * Multiple ResultSets will now auto-commit if all ResultSets are closed if auto-commit is turned on.
