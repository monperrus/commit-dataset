<D:comment>DERBY-3301, merging to 10.3: Follow-up patch to fix comments in 
subqueryFlattening.sql so that they match/explain the printed query plans, 
which changed slightly as a result of DERBY-3301. 

Merged with svn merge -r 619590:619591 ../derby-repro

Simple merge with no conflicts; no additional changes were necessary.
