<D:comment>CASSANDRA-296 fix grammar breakage

Changeset ada820 was an attempt to make hostname parsing less stupid,
(i.e. don't allow underscores; do allow hyphens; allow IP addresses).
It didn't entirely fix the problems it set out to and it broke
parsing of anything that used the "Identifier" lexer, (for example
the thrift {get,set} ... commands).

This changeset partially reverts ada820 until a proper fix to
hostname parsing can be found.</D:comment>
