<D:comment>DERBY-5121 Data corruption when executing an UPDATE trigger

      Changes made for DERBY-1482 caused corruption which is being worked 
       under DERBY-5121. The issue is that the generated trigger action
       sql could be looking for columns (by positions, not names) in
       incorrect positions. With DERBY-1482, trigger assumed that the
       runtime resultset that they will get will only have trigger columns
       and trigger action columns used through the REFERENCING column.
       That is an incorrect assumption because the resultset could have
       more columns if the triggering sql requires more columns. DERBY-1482
       changes are in 10.7 and higher codelines. Because of this bug, the
       changes for DERBY-1482 have been backed out from 10.7 and 10.8
       codelines so they now match 10.6 and earlier releases. This in 
       other words means that the resultset presented to the trigger
       will have all the columns from the trigger table and the trigger
       action generated sql should look for the columns in the trigger
       table by their absolution column position in the trigger table.
       This disabling of code will make sure that all the future triggers
       get created correctly. The existing triggers at the time of 
       upgrade (to the releases with DERBY-1482 backout changes in them)
       will get marked invalid and when they fire next time around with
       the release with DERBY-1482 changes backed out, the regenerated sql 
       for them will be generated again and they will start behaving 
       correctly. So, it is *highly* recommended that the users upgrade 
       from 10.7.1.1 to next point release of 10.7 or to 10.8
