<D:comment>DERBY-3898: Blob.setBytes differs between embedded and client driver
when the specified length is invalid

Added fix and test case for a remaining corner case: When the sum of
offset and length is greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE, the client driver
silently ignores the error whereas the embedded driver fails with an
IndexOutOfBoundsException.

The unexpected results are caused by a check for

  offset + len &gt; bytes.length

where offset+len overflows and evaluates to a negative value. The fix
changes this condition to the equivalent

  len &gt; bytes.length - offset

which won't overflow (because both bytes.length and offset are known
to be non-negative at this point in the code, and subtracting one
non-negative int from another is guaranteed to result in a value in
the range [-Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE]).
