<D:comment>DERBY-6045 (in list multi-probe by primary key not chosen on tables with &gt;256 rows)

Adding tow more test fixtures(testDerby6045WithUpdateStatistics and testDerby6045WithoutUpdateStatistics). 
Difference between the two fixtures is testDerby6045WithUpdateStatistics issues an update statistics after inserting the required number of rows in the table, where as testDerby6045WithoutUpdateStatistics does not issue an update statisitcs.
The code for them looks as follows
1)Create a brand new table with a primary key
2)Add 10 rows/24 rows/10,000 rows.
3)One of the test fixture(testDerby6045WithUpdateStatistics) will issue an update statistics at this time
4)Run following 3 queries and make sure they all use index scan
	SELECT * FROM newTable WHERE TERM_ID = 11
	SELECT * FROM newTable WHERE (TERM_ID = 11) OR (TERM_ID =21) OR (TERM_ID = 31)
	SELECT * FROM newTable WHERE (TERM_ID IN (11, 21, 31))
5)Drop the table
