<D:comment>DERBY-616, committing on behalf of Suresh Thalamati

- Added a missing privileged blocks for I/O call in StreamFileContainer.java ,
this class is used by the sort during index creation ..etc.

-- Enabled some of the tests which were not running under security manager
earlier because of this bug to run by default with security manager.

-- removed the additional permissions from the derby test policy file
that were added earlier to avoid this bug for some test cases.
