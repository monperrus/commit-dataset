<D:comment>DERBY-3302 The user was running into null pointer exception at the time of database recovery
because Derby was trying to get the Collator object through database context. But the 
Collator object is already available in the territory sensitive character classes and we
do not have to go to database context to get it. I changed the code to use that collator 
object rather than look into database context. The reason for null pointer exception was 
that database context was not loaded yet during database recovery.
