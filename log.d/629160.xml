<D:comment>DERBY-3299 (incremental): Updates ConglomerateDescriptor.java to include
logic for detecting a conglomerate "replacement" scenario, and adds logic
to drop the old (shared) conglomerate in those scenarios. Also changes
the various ConstantAction classes which rely on the "drop(...)" methods
of ConglomerateDescriptor and ConstraintDescriptor so that they use the
utility methods added as part of svn # 628181.  This commit is the one
which "activates" the previous changes for this issue and ultimately
changes Derby's behavior to fix the problem.  Test cases will be added
in a subsequent commit.
