<D:comment>DERBY-4175 Instability in some replication tests under load, since tests don't wait long enough for final state or anticipate intermediate states

Patch derby-4175-3 (+ resolved some conflicts arising from commit of DERBY-3417).

It makes three replication tests less sensitive to load by making
them accept intermediate states without failing or wait for longer
before giving up on seeing the final end state of a replication state
change.
