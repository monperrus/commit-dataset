<D:comment>State change wait timeouts and missed notifications.

Added a timeout when waiting for a subsystem state change when performing an operation. The timeout is 60 seconds and
currently not configurable. Might be good to make it configurable in the future.

Fixed an issue where there was a small window allowing a missed state change notification while waiting.</D:comment>
