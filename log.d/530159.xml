<D:comment>DERBY-2480: getConnection leaks memory when connecting to non-existent db

This patch was contributed by Jeff Clary (jclary@actuate.com). The test
program was contributed by John Embretsen (John.Embretsen@Sun.com) based
on the original reproduction program contributed by Jeff Clary.

The issue is that repeated calls to java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(
"jdbc:derby:C:\\DOES_NOT_EXIST") leak memory and eventually lead to an
OutOfMemoryError.

This bug is similar to DERBY-1947 in that ContextManager objects are not
getting removed from the HashSet. 

The change adds a call to cleanupOnError to EmbedConnection's constructor.
