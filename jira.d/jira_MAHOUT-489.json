There is indeed a problem with AllIterator being off-by-one at the end. I fixed that.\r\n2. The non-zero iterator test in the patch has a slight problem, in that it sets a value to 0 but then expects the non-zero iterator to return it. I adjusted that along with a few other small points in the test.\r\n3. Along the way I uncovered two smallish but probably important other problems: \r\n  - modifying an element via the all-elements iterator didn't clear the cached length squared. Hooray for unit tests; I knew this would continue to be a gotcha though...\r\n  - iterating over an empty vector would cause an exception :(\r\n\r\nCommit forthcoming.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"created":"2010-09-24T14:21:11.544+0000","updated":"2010-09-24T14:21:11.544+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12472700/comment/12914559","id":"12914559","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","emailAddress":"jira at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true},"body":"Integrated in Mahout-Quality #321 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Mahout-Quality/321/])\r\n    MAHOUT-489\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","emailAddress":"jira at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true},"created":"2010-09-24T17:50:53.847+0000","updated":"2010-09-24T17:50:53.847+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAHOUT-489/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04a9r:"}}
