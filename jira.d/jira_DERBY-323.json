The patch does:\r\n\r\n  1) Rewrite tools/derbyrunjartest.java to use jvm.getCommandLine() to\r\n     get the command line to start the test with.\r\n\r\n  2) Move the setting of user.language and user.country from RunTest\r\n     and NetServer to jvm.getCommandLine(). This way, all of the java\r\n     processes that are forked from the test harness or from a test\r\n     get the same locale.\r\n\r\n  3) Add Locale.setDefault(Locale.US) to RunTest.main(). This fixes\r\n     the issue with the nist tests.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, derbyall runs cleanly with most locales, for instance\r\npt_BR, de_DE and ja_JP.UTF-8. However, three tests in i18nTest fail\r\nwith some variants of Japanese locale. ja_JP.ujis and ja_JP.SJIS have\r\nthese three failures. ja_JP.eucJP has these failures on some\r\nplatforms. I would assume other locales with non-Unicode/non-Latin\r\ncharacter sets also could see these failures.\r\n\r\nThe failing tests are:\r\n\r\ni18n/urlLocale.sql\r\ni18n/messageLocale.sql\r\ni18n/iepnegativetests_ES.sql\r\n\r\nAll the failures are caused by non-ascii characters that are printed\r\nas '?' because they don't exist in the default character set for the\r\nlocale. I believe this could be fixed by a combination of running the\r\ni18n tests with -Dfile.encoding=something and specifying encoding to\r\nstreams/readers in RunTest.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-07-14T14:05:22.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-14T14:05:22.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/32970/comment/12422500","id":"12422500","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Sending        java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/harness/NetServer.java\r\nSending        java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/harness/RunTest.java\r\nSending        java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/harness/jvm.java\r\nSending        java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/tools/derbyrunjartest.java\r\nTransmitting file data ....\r\nCommitted revision 424072.\r\n\r\nMarking issue as fixed since the remaining failures are covered by DERBY-244.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-07-20T21:33:12.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-20T21:33:12.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/32970/comment/12551273","id":"12551273","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"body":"This issue has been resolved for over a year with no further movement.
