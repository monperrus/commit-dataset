Since mutateCounter and writeLocallyAndReplicate are symmetrical and are called depending on whether an IMutation is an instance of CounterMutation, could we move them onto IMutation, and polymorphically decide the behavior?\r\n\r\nHum, they are not really so symmetrical. In particular writeLocallyAndReplicate (or performWrite as it is called nowadays) really is polymorphic over the IMutation used.\r\nSo the only seem we we could do (at least easily) is moving some of mutateCounter in CounterMutation, but not sure it will look so great. Also, it is probably nice to keep all the code related to the write/read protocol in StorageProxy (doing otherwise would be like moving the query code out of CFStore, nobody wants that :D)\r\n\r\nbq.
