Specifically, there is a bit of code in SolrDispatchFilter that prints out the severeErrors if:\r\n\r\nif( abortOnConfigurationError && SolrConfig.severeErrors.size() > 0 ){\r\nprint stuff\r\n}\r\n\r\nWell, aborgOnConfigurationError is also deprecated with the comment:\r\n@deprecated all cores now abort on configuration error regardless of configuration\r\n\r\nBut apparently they no longer print out the stack trace that is helpful. And the line in 3x solrconfig.xml that set abortOnConfigurationError=true has been removed so it defaults to false. But even when true, printStackTrace doesn't print out on trunk, I don't quite know why. I hacked some stuff and going into that loop and printing out getMessage() from every Throwable in that collection *does* print a message. But I'm not going to worry about that now...\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder it this is related to this deprecation comment in SolrConfig.xml for severeErrors:\r\n\"@deprecated All exceptions encountered during config parsing are now thrown by the respective constructors, preventing initialization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n*********\r\nThe other issue is that two SolrException c'tors hard code \"logged=true\", which puzzles me:\r\n\r\n  public SolrException(ErrorCode code, Throwable th) {\r\n    super(th);\r\n    this.code=code.code;\r\n    logged=true;  <== what?\r\n  }\r\n\r\nWould it make more sense to do something like:\r\n   if (th instanceof SolrException) {\r\n      logged = ((SolrExcption)th).logged;\r\n    } else {\r\n      logged = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd something similar for the other constructor that hard-codes true that has this signature:\r\npublic SolrException(ErrorCode code, String msg, Throwable th)\r\n\r\nand let the default value of false stand otherwise? I could easily be persuaded that the else clause should be removed......\r\n\r\nAlthough this code hasn't changed since 3.x days, it still seems questionable to hard-code this to true.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the net-net of this is that we've lost some useful information. I'm not entirely comfortable with changing the constructors for SolrException to remove the hard-coded \"true\" without running it by folks. I would argue that doing what I outlined above makes sense, and if that results in more stack traces than we want people should use the c'tor that sets the logged value.

I think it needs to be changed.  Its used all over the place and in most cases, its a \"new SolrException\" being created and subsequently not being logged.  But why should a developer have to dig through the constructors to check for gotchas like this?\r\n\r\nHere's a patch that adds a new constructor so developers can specify their intentions:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\npublic SolrException(ErrorCode code, Throwable th, boolean alreadyLogged) \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd also changes the problem constructor to:\r\n{code}\r\npublic SolrException(ErrorCode code, Throwable th) {\r\n\tsuper(th);\r\n\tthis.code=code.code;\r\n\tif(th instanceof SolrException) {\r\n\t\tthis.logged=((SolrException) th).logged;\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tthis.logged = false;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nReviewing all the places this is used, I left most of them alone but changed a few to suppress logging (with the new constructor) in cases where the problem is obviously being logged already.  I also kept the suppressed logging for caught&wrapped \"InterrupedException\"s.\r\n\r\nDoing this will make the app a bit nosier but then again, each of these exceptions will log only once (right?).  If we apply this, I wouldn't be surprised if there might be a case or two we will find it needs to be changed back to suppress the log message.  But these should be easy to handle after-the-fact, right?\r\n\r\nProblem is, I'm not sure if this handles the issue you've discovered, when you have a bad RequestHandler in solrconfig.xml.  I tried this with this new patch applied and I still didn't get a meaningful message logged.  I'm now trying to get the latest trunk to deploy properly in my ide so I can debug...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdyer","name":"jdyer","emailAddress":"james dot dyer at ingrambook dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"James Dyer","active":true},"created":"2012-01-11T18:53:16.104+0000","updated":"2012-01-11T18:53:16.104+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12537953/comment/13184298","id":"13184298","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"looks like this is related to SOLR-2191","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2012-01-11T19:18:33.383+0000","updated":"2012-01-11T19:18:33.383+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12537953/comment/13184359","id":"13184359","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erickerickson","name":"erickerickson","emailAddress":"erickerickson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erick Erickson","active":true},"body":"Mark:\r\n\r\nYou're right, this is totally related. I think it would be better to conditionally set the logged value based on the current value when passing in a throwable. How about if James and I handle the SolrException bit? Or are you about to check in 2191? and we can close this one?\r\n\r\nJames:\r\n\r\nI had the same problem. There's another c'tor just above that one that looks like this:\r\n{code}\r\n  public SolrException(ErrorCode code, String msg, Throwable th) {\r\n    this(code,msg,th,true);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nThat's the actual one being called in the RequestHandler case.\r\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of zillion c'tors, perhaps all we really need is a comment for this c'tor\r\n{code}\r\n public SolrException(ErrorCode code, String msg, Throwable th, boolean alreadyLogged) \r\n{code}\r\nthat the msg can be null? In fact, it looks like both the msg and th parameters can all be null as far as the base java classes are concerned, so I wonder if we wouldn't be better off just making those c'tors all use the same one, like:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n  public SolrException(ErrorCode code, String msg) {\r\n    this(code, msg, null, false);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public SolrException(ErrorCode code, String msg, boolean alreadyLogged) {\r\n    this(code, msg, null, alreadyLogged);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public SolrException(ErrorCode code, String msg, Throwable th, boolean alreadyLogged) {\r\n    super(msg, th);\r\n    this.code = code.code;\r\n    logged = alreadyLogged;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public SolrException(ErrorCode code, String msg, Throwable th) {\r\n    this(code, msg, th, (th instanceof SolrException) ?

By the way, going through this revealed a lot of places where developers took pains to create nice loggable messages, but the SolrException constructor is making it so they'll never see the light of day.\r\n\r\nAs for the duplication of SOLR-2191, it would be nice if we can maybe apply something simple like this patch first and see if it seems to meet everyone's need.  Then if its not enough or if there still seems to be a reason to completely eliminate \"logOnce\", that could be done as a second step?  This way we can fix the lost logging messages now and still have the option to do more (or less) later.\r\n\r\nI agree having lots of constructors is not usually a good idea.  In an Exception class it might be nice though to retain them, giving developers added convenience.
