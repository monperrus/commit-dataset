One of the bundles testTwitter uses imports javax.xml.*, which sometimes wires to the system bundle while other times wires to another bundle com.springsource.org.apache.xmlcommons_1.3.4, which exports some of the javax.xml.* packages although with a higher version:(. As a consequence, we cannot be sure how many provision bundles we can get from felix obr. I modified our test to verify that we have at least two provisioning bundles, the ones we are expecting, instead of insisting on just having two bundles. This might be better in the long run, as the remote bundle repository content might change.\r\n\r\nThe patch was generated from trunk dir.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=emily","name":"emily","emailAddress":"emijiang at uk dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Emily Jiang","active":true},"created":"2010-10-26T16:38:10.089+0000","updated":"2010-10-26T16:38:10.089+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12478353/comment/12925334","id":"12925334","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mnuttall","name":"mnuttall","emailAddress":"mnuttall at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mark Nuttall","active":true},"body":"Fixed.
