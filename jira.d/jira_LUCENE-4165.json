It is (including examples) in the utility package (IOUtils). We should use this, as it correctly handles special cases like supressing Exceptions occuring on close(). It also ensures, *all* resources are closed.\r\n- from my perspective / in my opinion: the general contract in Java is, that methods getting streams or readers don't close. This is e.g. important if you have the stuff in a ZIP file and read it with ZIPInputStream. If you close that reader, you cannot read the other files in the archive anymore. So I would prefer to let the user close the files. Behavior in APIs is different for methods taking file names, of course. They close their internal streams. We also fixed other places in Lucene to respect this contract. E.g., IndexWriter does not close readers from Field instances.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-06-26T12:24:10.618+0000","updated":"2012-06-26T12:24:10.618+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595872/comment/13401350","id":"13401350","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmale","name":"cmale","emailAddress":"gento0nz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Male","active":true},"body":"So we should close any Readers we internally create (such as in readDictionaryFile()) but leave the InputStreams that have been passed in?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmale","name":"cmale","emailAddress":"gento0nz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Male","active":true},"created":"2012-06-26T12:37:54.640+0000","updated":"2012-06-26T12:37:54.640+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595872/comment/13401359","id":"13401359","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"If you close the Reader it automatically closes all underlying streams (see docs).

The only workaround is e.g. TIKA's CloseShieldInputStream. If you wrap it between the original stream and your InputStreamReader on top, then you can call close on the InputStreamReader.\r\n\r\nAbout the misunderstanding: The counterpart for close() is the ctor, and close() closes the \"underlying\" \"opened\" resource (this is what the docs says). This resource is the stream and nothing else. If you call close on a decorator (like InputStreamReader, BufferedInputStrea), the close call closes the underlying \"opened\" resource. It talks about nothing else.\r\n\r\nAs I said, XERCES UTF8Reader is already horribly broken, it violates Unicode specs and lots of other stuff + it is horribly slow, so its a bad example. If it allocates ThreadLocals, there is no need / requirement to release them on close(). Close() should only close the underlying resource, not any helpers around.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-06-26T14:02:41.066+0000","updated":"2012-06-26T14:02:41.066+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595872/comment/13401426","id":"13401426","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tkrah","name":"tkrah","emailAddress":"krah dot tm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Torsten Krah","active":true},"body":"Last 2 cents about the misunderstanding:\r\n\r\nDoc says: \"Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it.\".\r\n\r\nMay be read like this:\r\n\r\n1. \"it\" may actually mean the stream here -> \"Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.\"\r\n2. \"it\" just meaning the object (reader) itself -> \"Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with the reader.\"\r\n\r\nBoth is possible (is it?) and to me 2. would be more common, because @ variant 1. you do not know, if \"close\" on the stream does really release any system resources (this is up to the input streams close method, e.g. take the CloseShieldInputStream.) - so if 1. should be the only one meaning of the docs, they are promising things, which they can't enforce ;-).\r\nBut i guess i have to look at english grammer again (long long ago ...) - maybe this is really clear here how it must be understand - if 1. is the only possible one from a language perspective one, than it should imho read more like this:\r\n\r\n\"Does call close on the Stream.\" - not more, because you do not know if any system resources are freed; this should be documented at the close() method of the actual InputStream documentation used.\r\n\r\nBack to topic: I'll provide those patches asap.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tkrah","name":"tkrah","emailAddress":"krah dot tm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Torsten Krah","active":true},"created":"2012-06-26T14:28:19.313+0000","updated":"2012-06-26T14:28:19.313+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595872/comment/13402019","id":"13402019","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tkrah","name":"tkrah","emailAddress":"krah dot tm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Torsten Krah","active":true},"body":"Updated patches:\r\n\r\n1. removed reader.close() call in readAffixFile() function.\r\n2.
