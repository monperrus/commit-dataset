We will try to push them into update 1 (which is targeted only for security fixes) but we can't promise.\r\n\r\nThere is going discussion about using current Hotspot VM in future jdk6 updates but there is no decision yet. Note: current Hotspot VM sources are targeted for\r\nJDK8 and jdk7 updates only.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nVladimir\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis means, Java 7 will come out with heavy broken loops (so almost for any for or while loop you cannot make sure that it is still working correct when executed 10thousand times.\r\n\r\nWhat do others mean. Should we place a warning on the \"Download\" and \"News\" page on Solr and Lucene website? The risk is high that you corrupt your index, if you index using these JDK versions. Also the default configuration of Solr will SIGSEGV.\r\nWe should also inform the user mailing lists.\r\n\r\nI can prepare something and we can discuss? Oracle JDK 1.7.0 GA will be released on July 28th, according to Oracle's press releases. At least on that day we should have something available to present to the users.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot

But before my changes it was guarded by OptimizeStringConcat flag.

One was the UTF-8 jetty problem, then this PorterStemFilter came up and right after that Solr/Lucene crashes with OOM due to FieldCache problems. And there is still my plan to get FST for synonyms running. Dang, my day only has 24 hours.\r\nYes, I used -XX:+AggressiveOpts and as we know now thats the cause why JVM chrashed.\r\njava version \"1.6.0_22\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.1-b03, mixed mode)\r\nAfter the crashes with PorterStemFilter I removed AggressiveOpts from my JAVA_OPTS.\r\nNow I'm watching what Lucenes FieldCache is doing and if its still doubling its size until OOM.\r\nSo I'm deep inside :-)\r\n\r\nWell interesting idea to know that if I had filed an issue and that that one had been traced down a month ago that this might have been prevented a buggy release of java 1.7 ;-)\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=befehl","name":"befehl","emailAddress":"bernd dot fehling at uni-bielefeld dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernd Fehling","active":true},"created":"2011-07-29T11:51:48.989+0000","updated":"2011-07-29T11:51:48.989+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12515159/comment/13073818","id":"13073818","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"The SIGSEGV bug was already reported on the Elastic Search mailing list in January: [http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Java-6u23-and-ES-0-14-2-crashing-on-signal-6-SIGABT-td2289578.html]\r\n\r\nIt would have been nice, if Shay Bannon contacted us!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2011-08-01T22:06:07.436+0000","updated":"2011-08-01T22:06:07.436+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12515159/comment/13076053","id":"13076053","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimchy","name":"kimchy","emailAddress":"kimchy at mac dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shay Banon","active":true},"body":"@Uwe I actually forgot about this, and did not think it was because of the porter stemmer at the time, especially since I did try and reproduce it and never managed to (I thought it was coincidence it crashed there).
