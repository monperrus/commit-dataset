Removed it.  (Client code goes through apply(), which schedules put() on the executor.  So recover calling put directly is exactly what we want.)\r\n\r\nThe rest is removing comments that weren't actually accurate, and making startup messages more signal than noise (which is what made the problem clear).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot
