I have not seen any other classes in the package org.apache.derby.iapi.types, make use of impl classes, so I am not sure if it breaks some design-rule in derby. In this case, it could probably be ok, since we are not exposing the impl class to the client, only using it in the implementation of a class.\r\n\r\nAnother question is if we could avoid the cloning of the column somehow or if it is possible to use a shallow clone? As far as I can tell, the current cloning will do an inmemory copy of all data in the blob column, and if it is a 1GB blob, I think it will cause an OutOfMemory error.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andreask","name":"andreask","emailAddress":"andreas dot korneliussen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andreas Korneliussen","active":true},"created":"2006-06-27T16:30:31.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-27T16:30:31.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12344507/comment/12418583","id":"12418583","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andreask","name":"andreask","emailAddress":"andreas dot korneliussen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andreas Korneliussen","active":true},"body":"As part of fixing DERBY-802, I found that the call to rowChanger.updateRow(..) has destructive effect on the Blob columns, so that they cannot be used again in source.updateRow(..) when doing clone or if it is to be used for writing it into a disk hash table.\r\n\r\nI have therefore replaced the order of the calls in UpdatableResultSet.java, so that they are now:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tsource.updateRow(newBaseRow);\r\n\t\t\t\trowChanger.updateRow(row,newBaseRow,baseRowLocation);\r\n\r\nThis means that the hashtable in ScrollInsensitiveResultSet will be updated before the actual row is updated, however from the user this is atomic.\r\n\r\nWith the patch derby-1421v2.diff, I have kept all the tests in derby-1421.diff, however I have removed the changes in SQLBinary.
