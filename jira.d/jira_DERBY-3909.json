The test showed that the number of\r\noperations per interval decreased over time, and when I instrumented\r\nthe code I found that the vector xaResourceSameRMGroup_ in\r\nNetXAResource just kept growing. xaResourceSameRMGroup_ holds the\r\nsingly-linked lists that this issue was originally opened for.\r\n\r\nSince the vector is meant to have one item per resource manager\r\n(which, as I understand it, is a Derby network server in this\r\ncontext), and all the threads connect to the same server, the vector\r\nshould never have more than one element in this test.\r\n\r\nThe problem is this:\r\n\r\nNetXAResource.initForReuse() scans through the vector to find the\r\ncorrect group to add the XAResource to. The correct group is one for\r\nwhich isSameRM() returns true. XAResources that belong to the same\r\ngroup are chained.\r\n\r\nBut if the first XAResource in one of the chains belongs to a closed\r\nconnection whose XAResource has not yet been removed from the chain\r\n(yet another race condition), an XAException is raised, and\r\ninitForReuse() notices it and just continues the search on the next\r\nelement in the vector. If the group that was skipped because of the\r\nXAException, was the group that the XAResource actually should have\r\nbeen added to, the search won't find a matching group, and a new\r\nelement will be added to the vector. So we end up with multiple chains\r\nfor a single group.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the XAResource may even exist from before in the skipped\r\ngroup, it will end up two places in the vector. When the XAConnection\r\nis closed later on, only one of the occurrences of the XAResource will\r\nbe removed from the vector, which means that the vector could become\r\nvery large over time.\r\n\r\nEven worse, the next pointers used to chain NetXAResource objects that\r\nbelong to the same group, are not cleared when the object is removed\r\nfrom the chain or when the NetXAResource is added as the root of a new\r\ngroup. If it is already part of a group that was skipped because of an\r\nXAException, it could have a next pointer which points to another\r\nchain, and with some bad luck we could end up with a cycle in one of\r\nthe chains and make initForReuse() and removeXaresFromSameRMchain()\r\nvulnerable to infinite loops.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the problem could be solved simply by turning around the\r\ncall to NetXAResource.isSameRM() in initForReuse(), from\r\nxaResourceGroup.isSameRM(this) to isSameRM(xaResourceGroup). Since the\r\nconnection used by \"this\" is not closed, the XAException is not\r\nthrown, and the NetXAResource is added to the correct group.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't see that this data structure is used anywhere in the\r\ncode. The fields that build up the structure are only used in\r\ninitForReuse() and removeXaresFromSameRMchain(), so we only put things\r\nin and remove them, without doing anything useful with them in\r\nbetween. Given that the code that handles the data structure has a\r\nnumber of problems, is fairly complex and doesn't seem to do anything\r\nuseful, I would suggest that we remove it instead of trying to fix it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-10-12T14:49:52.837+0000","updated":"2008-10-12T14:49:52.837+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406239/comment/12638852","id":"12638852","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attaching the test I described in my previous comment.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-10-12T14:51:37.878+0000","updated":"2008-10-12T14:51:37.878+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406239/comment/12638853","id":"12638853","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Unchecking \"Patch Available\" since I believe that removing the code is a better fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-10-12T15:02:25.990+0000","updated":"2008-10-12T15:02:25.990+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406239/comment/12638908","id":"12638908","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attached is a new patch (d3909-remove.diff) which removes the methods removeXaresFromSameRMchain() and initForReuse() from NetXAResource, and it also removes all the now unused variables from that class.\r\n\r\nAll the regression tests ran cleanly.

There's also a TODO comment which says we should investigate other ways to do it.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't see the infinite loop after that commit, the potential for the infinite loop is still there, and I still see that the vector keeps growing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-10-15T13:06:59.665+0000","updated":"2008-10-15T13:06:59.665+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406239/comment/12639837","id":"12639837","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed d3909-remove.diff to trunk with revision 704904.\r\n\r\nI'm planning to back-port the fix to all branches back to 10.2 since users have seen this problem on 10.2.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-10-15T13:25:28.162+0000","updated":"2008-10-15T13:25:28.162+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406239/comment/12640148","id":"12640148","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed to 10.4 with revision 705218.\r\nCommitted to 10.3 with revision 705219.\r\nCommitted to 10.2 with revision 705220.\r\n\r\nMarking the issue as resolved since the problematic code has been removed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-10-16T12:10:50.621+0000","updated":"2008-10-16T12:10:50.621+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-3909/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i072nj:"}}
