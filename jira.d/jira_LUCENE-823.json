It looks\n    like this was part of the fix for LUCENE-436.  I just added the\n    call to close.\n\n    This is somewhat severe since we could leak many file handles for\n    use cases that burn through threads and/or indexes.  Though,\n    FSIndexInput does have a finalize() to close itself.\n\n  * Flushing of deletes in IndexWriter opens SegmentReader to do the\n    flushing, and it correctly calls close() to close the reader.  But\n    if an exception is hit during commit and before actually closing,\n    it will leave open those handles.  I fixed this first calling\n    doCommit() and then doClose() in a finally.  The \"disk full\" tests\n    we now have were hitting this.\n\n  * IndexWriter's addIndexes(IndexReader[]) method was opening a\n    reader but not closing it with a try/finally.  I just put a\n    try/finally in.\n\nI've also changed some unit tests to use MockRAMDirectory instead of\nRAMDirectory to increase testing coverage of \"leaking open file\nhandles\".\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10120","value":"Patch Available","id":"10120"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"27225","summary":"Lucene fails to close file handles under certain situations","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":5,"total":5,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364057/comment/12477791","id":"12477791","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"> TermInfosReader.close() was setting its ThreadLocal enumerators to\r\n >  null without first closing the SegmentTermEnum in there.\r\n\r\nAre you sure descriptors are really leaked in this case?\r\nThere are other cases where Lucene doesn't close IndexInput clones... see LUCENE-686\r\n\r\nThe SegmentTermEnum constructor is only called in two places:\r\n -
