It could be hooked into the Debian package and would alleviate user configuration errors.  It would generate the configuration as a data structure and then convert it to the storage backend of choice.  It would also warn and insert any missing parameters.  This would be independent of the internal Cassandra validation but maybe they can share a common definition of the parameters and their default values.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tzz","name":"tzz","emailAddress":"tzz at lifelogs dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Zlatanov","active":true},"created":"2010-02-01T16:19:52.071+0000","updated":"2010-02-01T16:19:52.071+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12444752/comment/12830128","id":"12830128","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tzz","name":"tzz","emailAddress":"tzz at lifelogs dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Zlatanov","active":true},"body":"I've done some significant configuration changes in CASSANDRA-754.
