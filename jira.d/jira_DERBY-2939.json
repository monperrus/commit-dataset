The assumption that the log record is too big to fit in any LogAccessFileBuffer is correct because the method LogAccessFile.reserveSpaceForChecksum is always called from LogToFile#appendLogRecord before LogAccessFile.writeLogRecord is called. reserveSpace... allocates a fresh LogAccessFileBuffer if the LogRecord is too big to fit in the current one. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are two remaining issues with LogAccessFile#writeLogRecord that I would like to address:\r\n\r\n1. Document the not too obvious behavior described above.\r\n2. Change what happens when a log record is too big to fit into any of the allocated LogAccessFileBuffers the following way:\r\n \r\n* Current strategy: \r\n------------------------\r\nflushDirtyBuffers (1 disk write for every dirty buffer)\r\n4x disk writes to put the very big log record to disk\r\n\r\n* New strategy\r\n-----------------------\r\nflushDirtyBuffers (as above)\r\nallocate a big enough buffer\r\nput the log record into the new buffer\r\n1x disk write to put the giant log record to disk\r\nremove the newly created buffer\r\n\r\nHence, I want to swap 3 disk write operations with main memory operations, which should be much faster. Note that the writeLogRecord method is called from a synchronized context in LogToFile. Thus, the 4 current disk writes are blocking all other transactions that try to append log.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jorgenlo","name":"jorgenlo","emailAddress":"jorgen dot loland at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jørgen Løland","active":true},"created":"2007-09-20T12:48:19.765+0000","updated":"2007-09-20T12:48:19.765+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12373890/comment/12529439","id":"12529439","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jorgenlo","name":"jorgenlo","emailAddress":"jorgen dot loland at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jørgen Løland","active":true},"body":"Attaching a patch, v1, that adds some clearifying comments and makes the code change described above.

The approach of the patch looks good,\r\nand I have the following review comments:\r\n\r\n1. I am wondering whether the code would be simpler if you wrote the\r\n   checksum for the big log record to the big buffer instead of to the\r\n   current buffer.  That is, the big log record will have its separate\r\n   check-sum.  I would think that would make it possible to avoid any\r\n   special handling of this case in switchLogBuffers. \r\n\r\n2. I did not follow why you need to update the checksum of\r\n   currentBuffer in the long-log-record case.  As far as I can tell,\r\n   nothing new has been written to that buffer.\r\n\r\n3. The comment says that \"The log record is therefore written directly\r\n   to log file instead of to buffer.\", but this is not correct anymore\r\n   since now large log records are also written to a buffer.\r\n\r\n4. With this code:\r\n       currentBuffer.position = newpos;\r\n       currentBuffer.bytes_free -=total_log_record_length;\r\n   different values are used to update two dependent variables.  I\r\n   think you should consider an assert that checks that\r\n   position+bytes_free equals the size of the buffer.  (Minor nit: A\r\n   missing space after '=' on the second code line shown above)\r\n\r\n5. Have you verified that the tests that you have run have ever\r\n   executed the code for large log records?  I am a bit sceptical to\r\n   checking in code that has not been tested.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=oysteing","name":"oysteing","emailAddress":"oystein dot grovlen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Øystein Grøvlen","active":true},"created":"2007-09-24T10:11:22.569+0000","updated":"2007-09-24T10:11:22.569+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12373890/comment/12529865","id":"12529865","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jorgenlo","name":"jorgenlo","emailAddress":"jorgen dot loland at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jørgen Løland","active":true},"body":"Thanks for reviewing the patch, Øystein. Patch 3 addresses your comments:\r\n\r\nRe 1: Very good point. This is modified in the current patch. Instead of letting writeChecksumLogRecord assume that it should write the checksum to the currentBuffer, the byte[] it should be written to is now sent as a parameter. \r\n\r\nRe 4: This code is copied from the old method, but with modified variable names and a simple call to a private method. It should therefore be well tested. That aside, an assert is still a good\r\nidea, so I added one.\r\n\r\nRe 5: I understand your concerns about making mistakes in the logging subsystem. I have therefore executed all the junit tests on the patch, but with a modified buffer size of only 70\r\nbytes (normally 32kB). Subtracting 37 bytes for the checksum log record, this means that almost all log records are too big to fit in a buffer. I have also played around with ij with this setting and not found any problems during recovery of a database stopped with C-c. Feel free to suggest other ways to test this ...\r\n\r\nI am currently running derbyall and all suites with normal buffer size.
