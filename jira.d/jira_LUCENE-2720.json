This is fine for 3.1 and onwards indexes, however what do we do w/ 3.0 ones? We will need to distinguish >=3.1 and <3.1. However, <3.1 covers both 3.0 (which we should support by 4.0) and 2.9 (which we shouldn't).

I think we can just use the stored fields file, since it changed as of 3.0?\r\n\r\nWe discussed this in IRC shortly before:\r\nTo detect a pre-3.0 index, it's enough to read the StoredFields file (is it really *always* available?). So 3.x and 4.0 do the following in the ctors/open:\r\n- if segments file is 3.x format, it contains information about util.Version -> we are fine no more work. In 4.0 we are happy with the index\r\n- Only trunk: if segments file is older format, read the StoredFields file in ctor. This would throw IndexFormatTooOldEx in 4.0 (this is additional work, if stored fields are not needed, but neglectible). Once the index is modified, we know about\r\n\r\nOnce an index is modified with 3.x or 4.0 we always update the version and write new segment information. For older segments, this code also has to inspect the stored fields file, to detect if segment is pre-3.x.
