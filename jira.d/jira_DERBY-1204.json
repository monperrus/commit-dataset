I have two small comments, and a request:\r\n\r\n1) The original reporter already added a test case for the bug to triggerGeneral.sql.\r\nI think the new test cases are quite good and should be retained, but I think we\r\nshould also enable the existing test case. It might also be reasonable to put\r\nthe test cases together in the file, either by moving the existing test case to the\r\nend where the new cases are, or by adding the new cases in the middle, next to\r\nthe existing test case.\r\n\r\n2) There appears to be an unnecessary whitespace-only diff change in CreateTriggerNode.\r\n\r\nThe request: I think that DERBY-1644 is rather similar to this, in that both cases involve\r\nincorrect handling of the intermediate nodes in the UnionNode tree that is constructed\r\nfor a INSERT statement with a multi-row VALUES clause. Although the two proposed\r\nfixes are completely independent, I was hoping that you could have a look at DERBY-1644,\r\nand perhaps see what you think of my proposed change. I'm a bit concerned that my\r\nproposed change turned out to be more complicated than was necessary, and perhaps\r\nyou will see a simpler way to fix the problem if you have a look at that issue.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-11-25T17:24:04.000+0000","updated":"2006-11-25T17:24:04.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12331960/comment/12453816","id":"12453816","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"body":"Hi Bryan.
