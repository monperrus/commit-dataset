I have not quite got to\r\nthe bottom of it, but so far it seems to me that it is not a deadlock\r\nscenario, but just timeouts due to long queues on the dictionary lock.\r\n(See below for more info).\r\n\r\nSince creating 100 tables in parallel is not a common scenario, I am\r\nnot sure whether it is worth the effort to attempt fix this so the\r\ntest runs cleanly.  ( The test was made to test a fix (Derby-230) that\r\nI do not think is very likely to reoccur.)  I have suggested on\r\nderby-dev take we should just remove the test from derbyall.  No one\r\nhas protested so I will create a patch to do that.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=oysteing","name":"oysteing","emailAddress":"oystein dot grovlen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Øystein Grøvlen","active":true},"created":"2006-02-21T18:01:18.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-21T18:01:18.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12327357/comment/12367165","id":"12367165","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=oysteing","name":"oysteing","emailAddress":"oystein dot grovlen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Øystein Grøvlen","active":true},"body":"Attached derby-800.diff which removes lang/ConcurrentImplicitCreateSchema.java from derbyall.\r\nFiles that are changed:\r\n\r\nM      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/suites/derbylang.runall\r\nM      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/suites/derbynetmats.runall\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=oysteing","name":"oysteing","emailAddress":"oystein dot grovlen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Øystein Grøvlen","active":true},"created":"2006-02-21T18:06:52.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-21T18:06:52.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12327357/comment/12367322","id":"12367322","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bernt","name":"bernt","emailAddress":"bernt at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernt M.
