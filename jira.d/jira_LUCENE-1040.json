supports fast lookup lookup of strings, and StopFilter.next should be responsible for lowercasing the terms before doing the set lookup (and makeStopSet should be responsible for lowercasing hte tersm before putting them in the set).  it would probably be good to change the sigs to something like StopFilter(TokenStream s, Set stopWords, boolean lowerCaseBeforeLookup) and makeStopSet(String[] stopWords, boolean lowerCaseBeforeAdding) so it was clear what expectations StopFilter has on the set if people make one from scratch.\r\n\r\nthis is kind of an orthogonal API discussion to the CharArraySet issue though ... the same arguments could be made about the 2.2 instance of StopFilter ... i just bring it up as a potential point of confusion since people could expect these two work the same way, and they wont (unless i'm missing something)...\r\n\r\n   Set a = ...; // something with lots of mixed case words\r\n   Set b = new CharArraySet(a, false);\r\n   StopFilter aaa = new StopFilter(stream, a, true)\r\n   StopFilter bbb = new StopFilter(stream, b,
