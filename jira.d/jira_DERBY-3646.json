Waagan","active":true},"body":"After a little investigation, I found out it is easy enough to make the embedded driver behave as the client driver.\r\nI'm not sure what is the best  exact implementation of the fix, which is currently a three line hack.\r\nBefore working further with that, I'd like to see the community agree on what kind of behavior we want to allow.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have gathered, the spec doesn't really give anything concrete, but talks about what is recommended for maximum portability.\r\n\r\nAlso, my first assessment is that it should be possible to allow almost anything, but that this can have significant performance implications (might include overhead for the simplest use cases as well).\r\nFor reference, I'm listing some options, all with regard to the statement \"SELECT blobclolumn as b1, blobcolumn as b2 from blobtable\".\r\nThe code examples are pseudo-JDBC/Java.\r\n\r\na) Disallow selecting the same [Blob] column twice.\r\n   Statement must be disallowed.\r\n\r\nb) Allow getting and processing a single stream in the order of the columns.\r\n   streamB1 = rs.getBinaryStream(b1)\r\n   processStream(streamB1)\r\n   streamB2 = rs.getBinaryStream(b2) // streamB1 is automatically closed here\r\n   processStream(streamB2)\r\n\r\nc) Allow getting and processing a single stream in any column order.\r\n   streamB2 = rs.getBinaryStream(b2)\r\n   processStream(streamB2)\r\n   streamB1 = rs.getBinaryStream(b1) // streamB2 is automatically closed here\r\n   processStream(streamB1)\r\n\r\nd) Allow getting and processing multiple streams in any order, but only once per column.\r\n   streamB2 = rs.getBinaryStream(b2)\r\n   streamB1 = rs.getBinaryStream(b1) // streamB2 is kept open\r\n   processStream(streamB2)\r\n   processStream(streamB1)\r\n\r\ne) Allow getting and processing mulitple streams in any order, multiple times per column.\r\n   streamB2 = rs.getBinaryStream(b2)\r\n   streamB1 = rs.getBinaryStream(b1) // streamB2 is kept open\r\n   processStream(streamB2)\r\n   streamB2seond = rs.getBinaryStream(b2)  // other streams are kept open\r\n   processStream(streamB1)\r\n   processStream(streamB2second)\r\n  \r\nFor options d and e, I expect the state of each stream (position, open/closed) to be independent of each other. Also, a stream returned from getBinaryStream should be positioned at the beginning of the data.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of things I haven't considered, so please comment on this!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot

Waagan","active":true},"body":"There are a few extra pieces of information for this issue:\r\n - Dag discovered a problem with the repro and also a bug in Derby, see his comments on DERBY-447 and the bug reported as DERBY-4521.\r\n - wrt the list above Derby now allows items a, b, and c. I think options d and e are disallowed by JDBC and the following statement from the getBinaryStream JavaDoc:\r\n    \"Note: All the data in the returned stream must be read prior to getting the value of any other column. The next call to a getter method implicitly closes the stream. Also, a stream may return 0 when the method InputStream.available  is called whether there is data available or not.\"\r\n\r\n    I think we could implement d if we wanted to, and maybe even e - but the latter would probably come with a performance hit. Since JDBC seems to disallow these behaviors, disallowing them in Derby seems like a good approach to me.\r\n - if DERBY-3844 patch 1a is committed, you are only allowed to call get[BC]lob once on a column per row. In this case the LOB object isn't closed / freed on the next getX-call.\r\n\r\nFixed by the combination of DERBY-4477 and DERBY-4520.\r\nVerified against trunk revision 980933, but it would be nice if the reporter verified the fix as well.\r\n\r\nI do not plan to back-port the fix(es) due to the rather signficant changes involved, but it may be technically possible.
