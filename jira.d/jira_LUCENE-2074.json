The 31-version is different (other matrix).\r\n\r\nIf we later create new versions, we can call them 32 etc.\r\n\r\nThis patch solves the JFlex 1.4 problem with needing the explicit java version. It currently requires the trunk version of JFlex, which would be no problem for this parsers (as verified, that they produce the same DFA & code for 1.4). So other speak up, Steven Rowe? What do you think. Only developers need the trunk version at the moment as the generated files are in the checkout.\r\n\r\nHopefully JFlex 1.5 comes out until we release 3.1, I would be happy. In later issues we can optimize the newly added 31 version with more unicode features, the Orig version stays as it is.

This one waits for a long time (why? for JFlex 1.5 release?) and protecting against a huge buffer allocation can be a real quick and tiny fix.

But the buffer size is not a critical issue either that we need to move fast with it ... so it's your call. Just thought they are two unrelated problems.{quote}\r\n\r\nAgreed.
