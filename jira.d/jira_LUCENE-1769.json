The autodetection of clover 1.x is not able to find out which files are the correct tests and only instruments the backwards test. Because of this, the current coverage report is only from the backwards tests running against the current Lucene JAR.\r\n\r\nYou can see this, if you install clover and start the tests. During test-core no clover data is added to the db, only when backwards-tests begin, new files are created in the clover db folder.\r\n\r\nClover 2.x supports a new ant task, <testsources> that can be used to specify the files, that are the tests. It works here locally with clover 2.4.3 and produces a really nice coverage report, also linking with test files work, it tells which tests failed and so on.\r\n\r\nI will attach a patch, that changes common-build.xml to the new clover version (other initialization resource) and tells clover where to find the tests (using the test folder include/exclude properties).\r\n\r\nOne problem with the current patch: It does *not* instrument the backwards branch, so you see only coverage of the core/contrib tests. Getting the coverage also from the backwards tests is not easy possible because of two things:\r\n- the tag test dir is not easy to find out and add to <testsources> element (there may be only one of them)\r\n- the test names in BW branch are identical to the trunk tests. This completely corrupts the linkage between tests and code in the coverage report.\r\n\r\nIn principle the best would be to generate a second coverage report for the backwards branch with a separate clover DB. The attached patch does not instrument the bw branch, it only does trunk tests.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10120","value":"Patch Available","id":"10120"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"26275","summary":"Fix wrong clover analysis because of backwards-tests, upgrade clover to 2.6.3 or better","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":31,"total":31,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12431827/comment/12737184","id":"12737184","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"This patch uses the features ov clover 2.0.\r\n\r\nWe can only commit this to trunk, when hudson is able to use clover 2.0.

This means that all of the src and test java files in contrib will also be instrumented by clover, if that is what you want?\r\n\r\nNot really, my intention was to only instrument the source files using the tests  (I can see this, that during compilation it tells me that XXX files are instrumented). This is how it was before.\r\n\r\nThe <testsources> tag in the clover setup was added, because the backwards-branch tests (ant test-tag)  completely broke the clover run (as clover was not able to automatically figure out, which are the real test files that should be run to instrument the source - maybe because the backwards branch is checked out on the fly using svn).  Because of this I added explicitely the source files to <testsources> in the init task - see my patch. Since I did this, it works as exspected. I used the already defined variables for that.\r\n\r\nWithout this <testsources> you cannot see any instrumentation data generated during run of tests (see above), it seems, that clover only instruments during the backwards-branch tests. With the explicit tests in <testsources> it works as exspected.\r\n\r\nbq. I added the <testsources/> element to both the HTML and the XML report tasks too. This ensures that the coverage of your test cases themselves are reported in a seperate section of each report.\r\n\r\nThis is good, because without that clover-report does not see the contrib tests, only the core tests (during the compilation and instrumentation of contrib it works, as each contrib is run in a subant.

If somebody do not want to put his clover.jar into the ant build dir, we could add a property that can be added to the local build.properties file. Or the user can run with \"ant -lib ...\". Alternatively we could add a ant task, that download the clover license and jar from Apache's private Committer SVN. We do this with other JAR files, too.

That method only returns true for unicode Unicode 4.0 characters in java 1.5, and 1.6 I believe.

It was me trying to fix the above mentioned bug.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=npellow","name":"npellow","emailAddress":"npellow at atlassian dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nick Pellow","active":true},"created":"2009-08-05T09:00:56.685+0000","updated":"2009-08-05T09:00:56.685+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12431827/comment/12739388","id":"12739388","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=npellow","name":"npellow","emailAddress":"npellow at atlassian dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nick Pellow","active":true},"body":"bq. we have some \"untested\" code parts (because the methods are never called by core).\r\n\r\nAre these untested parts in the test cases?

My problems are currently:\r\nThe tests are not directly  instumented (neither in core nor contrib nor bw). Currenty the core classes and contrib classes are instrumented. The testcases are linked in clover-setup via <testsources>, if I leave this out, I get 0% coverage. The backwards tests do not appear in testsources. Because of that, the tests still call the instrumented classes, but the coverage report shows no coverage. You can easily see this e.g. for the old HitCollector backwards compatibility code. Also during running of the bw-tests, no additional files are created during tests runs in the db folder.\r\nIf I add the bw-test cases with testsources to the clover config, the clover report mixes the linkage of the tests together and you see sometimes 2 test with same name hitting the same method and so on.\r\nIs there a possibility to tell clover, that you do not want to explicitely link the testcases of the backwards test and just measure coverage regardless of which class called the instrumented classes? I do not know, why the calls from \"unknown\" tests are not counted for the coverage.\r\n\r\nEDIT: If I run \"ant test-tag\" alone with a fresh created clover database, it seems to work. It shows the coverage in the methods called by the tests, but the tests itsself do not appear in the report (as it should be, because only the core tests are added to testsources). It seems to be only a problem, when the backwards and core tests are both instrumented to the same database. Maybe the equal testnames/classes lead to problems.\r\n\r\nI will test this further on Friday, I have no time now, but I think, the problem seems to be solveable. Maybe I had some misunderstanding in the clover report. I will compare then the three different reports (core, backwards, core+backwards combined) for differences. Maybe all is good :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2009-08-05T10:46:02.513+0000","updated":"2009-08-05T11:26:08.734+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12431827/comment/12739842","id":"12739842","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=npellow","name":"npellow","emailAddress":"npellow at atlassian dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nick Pellow","active":true},"body":"Hi Uwe, \r\n\r\nClover will still produce code coverage for your application sources, regardless of the tests being instrumented or not.\r\n\r\nDid you try the using following fileset in clover-setup from my patch?:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n<fileset dir=\"src\">\r\n            <!-- see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1772 -->\r\n            <include name=\"**/org/apache/**\"/>\r\n</fileset>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nClover will automatically detect any tests it finds as it instruments the source code.\r\n\r\nAlso, to remove the need to have the clover.jar on Ant's classpath, it is best to use the classpath on the taskdef for cloverlib.xml like so: \r\n{code}\r\n<property name=\"clover.jar\" value=\"path/to/clover.jar\"/>\r\n<taskdef resource=\"cloverlib.xml\" classpath=\"${clover.jar}\"/>\r\n{code}\r\nThis makes upgrading the version of clover being used very easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will upload a dev build of Clover 2.6 for you to test with the new org.apache site license.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=npellow","name":"npellow","emailAddress":"npellow at atlassian dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nick Pellow","active":true},"created":"2009-08-06T00:39:32.442+0000","updated":"2009-08-06T00:39:32.442+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12431827/comment/12739854","id":"12739854","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=npellow","name":"npellow","emailAddress":"npellow at atlassian dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nick Pellow","active":true},"body":"I've provided a download of the jar, just for you [here|http://www.atlassian.com/software/clover/downloads/binary/clover-2.6.0-dev.jar].
