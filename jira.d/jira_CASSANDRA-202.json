Therefore, for debugging purpose, it is useful to know the exact parameters that triggered the exceptions.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=junrao","name":"junrao","emailAddress":"junrao at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jun Rao","active":true},"created":"2009-06-01T16:41:42.067+0000","updated":"2009-06-01T16:41:42.067+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426535/comment/12715152","id":"12715152","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"I'm skeptical that this would actually be useful in a real-world situation.
