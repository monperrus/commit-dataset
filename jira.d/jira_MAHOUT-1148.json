This is a bit bold to do, but I think that the benefits are large enough to really make a difference.  The tests on the QR decomposition are pretty strict so the results should drop in.  The exception would be if somebody is checking the content of the QR decomposition itself rather than just its results since there are likely sign changes relative to the old implementation.\r\n\r\nThis impacts the ALS code including the implicit solvers.  I am hoping that we have good tests on those and will see any problems quickly.\r\n\r\nI have also not run the full suite of tests.
