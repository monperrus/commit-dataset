For example, here is a snip of code\r\nfrom CreateIndexNode.bindStatement:\r\n\r\n                /* Statement is dependent on the TableDescriptor */\r\n                getCompilerContext().createDependency(td);\r\n\r\nHowever, this isn't quite so easy with the CREATE TABLE statement, because\r\nthe table descriptor doesn't exist during compilation, since the table isn't\r\ncreated until the statement is actually executed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the attached patch registers the dependency at execution time. At\r\nthe very end of CreateTableConstantAction.executeConstantAction, there is\r\nsome new code added to register a dependency from the CREATE TABLE\r\nstatement to the table we have just finished creating.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet run the full regression suite, just the repro script.
