The description of the WwdEmbedded.java program in the HTML generated from the file rwwdactivity3.dita (http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/dev/workingwithderby/) contains the following paragraph:\r\n\r\nDERBY EXCEPTION REPORTING CLASSES: The two methods at the end of the file, errorPrint and SQLExceptionPrint, are generic exception reporting routines that can be used with any JDBC program. This type of exception handling is required because often multiple exceptions (SQLException) are chained together then thrown. A while loop is used to report on each error in the chain. These classes are used by calling the errorPrint method from the catch block of the code that accesses the database.\r\n\r\nThe introductory text \"DERBY EXCEPTION REPORTING CLASSES\" is keyed to a comment with the same text in the DERBY_HOME/demo/programs/workingwithderby/WwdEmbedded.java program:\r\n\r\n     //   ## DERBY EXCEPTION REPORTING CLASSES  ## \r\n\r\n    /***     Exception reporting methods\r\n\r\n    **      with special handling of SQLExceptions\r\n\r\n    ***/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there are no Derby exception reporting classes, only methods, as far as I can tell. The use of the term CLASSES is likely to confuse any users not well acquainted with Java (one of the target audiences of this manual). It would be great if someone could change CLASSES to METHODS in the WwdEmbedded.java file so that I can make the corresponding fix to the rwwdactivity3.dita file. I would also have to correct the confusing last sentence of the paragraph; I think it would make more sense to say, \"The program starts this process by calling the errorPrint method from the catch block of the code that accesses the database.\" (I can't just change \"classes\" to \"methods\" because errorPrint *is* one of the methods.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"36863","summary":"Misleading text in WwdEmbedded demo source file for Working With Derby","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chaase3","name":"chaase3","emailAddress":"camilla dot haase at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kim Haase","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310090":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chaase3","name":"chaase3","emailAddress":"camilla dot haase at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kim Haase","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12310050":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10052","value":"Normal","id":"10052"},"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":30,"total":30,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12353884/comment/12728655","id":"12728655","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Triaged for 10.5.2.\r\n\r\nWorking With Derby has now been merged with Getting Started with Derby (DERBY-2390), but the problematic text is still there - http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/dev/getstart/rwwdactivity3.html.\r\n\r\nOne alternative way to fix it is to remove the exception reporting methods altogether (both from code and from docs). I think the reason why they were written in the first place, was that Java 1.3 didn't have initCause/getCause.
