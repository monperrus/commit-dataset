We _do_ seem evidently record the baseUrl associated with a nodeName in the info about each _replica_ -- but that information is per collection & shard, so as is it doesn't really help in the general case of the bad code in OverseerCollectionProcessor.\r\n\r\nThree options occur to me...\r\n\r\n1) We could consider adding these mappins to ZK as 1st order info. possibly by adding some data to the ephemeral \"liveNodes\" path for each node, so code like OverseerCollectionProcessor could just ask for the data of each liveNode to know it's baseUrl ... but i'm not sure how far down that rabithole we want to go (i don't really know the performance characteristics of ZK enough to know if it's a good idea to have code doing lots of those kinds of lookups ad-hoc)\r\n\r\n2) we could cheat: we could add something like this to ClusterState...\r\n{code}\r\nprivate final Map<String,String> baseUrls;\r\npublic String getBaseUrl(final String nodeName);\r\n{code}\r\n...and populate the baseUrls Map in the constructor based on the properties found when looping over every collections->slice->replica.  The only question is what to do if/when two diff collections/slice/replica in the clusterstate disagree about the baseUrl?  (assertion failed?)\r\n\r\n3) We could improve the kludge to be a bit less kludgy: OverseerCollectionProcessor (and possibly other places) currently assume that a baseUrl can be computed from a nodeName by replacing all \"\\_\" with \"/\" -- if we change that substitution to only apply to the _first_ \"\\_\" in the nodeName, and combine it with some URL decoding on the \"hostContext\" portion of the nodeName (to match my suggested improvement in theprevious patch) i think we would have a fairly safe way of bi-directinally converting nodeName<->URL regardless of what's in the hostContext - because hostnames and ports can't ever have \"\\_\" in them.  (this wouldn't address the \"http://\" kludge, but that assumption seems to be more pervasive - we can fight that battle another day)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOption #3 seems the invasive for now, so unless mark/yonik/sami/somebody chimes in with more encouragment to go down one of the other routes, i'll take a stab at #3 and see what other problems i encounter.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2012-12-05T19:19:24.153+0000","updated":"2012-12-05T19:19:24.153+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618516/comment/13510710","id":"13510710","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"Yeah, I've looked at this in the past because we have problems with _ in the url's the way things are now (there are comments to that affect).

I put the new public method for getting the baseURL of a nodeName in SolrZkClient in case we want to change it to be a live lookup from ZK at some point (and marked it @lucene.experimental in case we want completely move/remove it at some point)\r\n\r\n2) improved ZkController to allow both leading and trailing \"/\" in the hostContext -- both of which get striped off _after_ the \"empty string defaults to 'solr'\" logic, and _before_ the generation of the nodeName.  As as result, specifying {{hostContext=\"/\"}} in solr.xml is now a viable way to tell solr it's running in the root context.  (In general i think this makes things easier to use, but \r\n\r\n3) enhanced the hostContext randomization logic in BaseDistributedSearchTestCase so that it randomly uses: the root context (eg: \"/\"), one level paths (eg: \"/as\"), two level paths (eg: \"/s/bf\"), and, sometimes including an \"_\" character in a path (eg: \"/as_\", \"/s_d\", \"/_d/bf\", etc..)\r\n\r\n4) Changed BaseDistributedSearchTestCase to us the context path randomization logic by default.  This is something i had left out of my previous patch because i wa worried about users who might have their own tests extending BaseDistributedSearchTestCase that were then making assumptions about the context being \"/solr\" -- but i decided having more test coverage using these random context paths was more important -- we can include an upgrade note along the lines of...\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nBaseDistributedSearchTestCase now randomizes the servlet context it uses when \r\ncreating Jetty instances.  Subclasses that assume a hard coded context of \r\n\"/solr\" should either be fixed to use the \"String context\" variable, or should \r\ntake advantage of the new BaseDistributedSearchTestCase(String) constructor\r\nto explicitly specify a fixed servlet context path.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n5) Fixed test bugs exposed by 3 & 4 above.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nMark: would really appreciate it if you could take this bad-boy for a spin and let me know what you think\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot

In a mocked test you mock components used by the \"class under test\" (OverseerCollectionProcessor in this case) and basically tells those mocks how to behave when used by the \"class under test\". This way you test only the logic in the \"class under test\" and at the same time you get to verify that it communicates (calles stuff on) the components in interacts with (the mocked ones) in exactly the way you expect. I guess you have changed createCollection so that it also calls zkStateReaderMock.getZkClient().getBaseUrlForNodeName() which it didnt before, so that call wasnt \"expected\" by the test and you didnt tell the mocked component (ZkStateReader) how to \"simulate\" correct behaviour. Mark added this and the test should be fine again. \r\n\r\nBasically since you changed createCollection in a way so that it did not anylonger behave exactly as verified by the OverseerCollectionProcessorTest you needed to tweak the test also.
