Merged\r\n2. Using FBS is possible, though it's a larger change than the fix, perhaps handle this in a seperate issue?\r\n3. IMHO that's a waste for a large index. While allocating a large array is faster, it takes a lot of memory - probably for no reason. Each query will take longer, but concurrent queries will not hurt the GC that much. If the index is large concurrent queries might hit the GC hard, perhaps even OOM ?
