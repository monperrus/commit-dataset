Remember also the DirectSolrSpellChecker is a different spellchecker totally than IndexBasedSpellChecker (it uses a fundamentally different algorithm), although I tried to keep some of the parameters consistent.\r\n\r\nAnother question is, there are lots of other float/int arguments to DirectSolrSpellChecker, maybe we should cut all of these over to <int> and <float> while we are here?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2011-06-03T16:04:46.407+0000","updated":"2011-06-03T16:04:46.407+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12509014/comment/13044909","id":"13044909","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdyer","name":"jdyer","emailAddress":"james dot dyer at ingrambook dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"James Dyer","active":true},"body":"This version takes all of DirectSolrSpellChecker's parameters as Integer and Float objects rather than Strings, as appropriate.

Here's the basic jist (I think!) :\r\n - If the instance of SolrSpellChecker returns frequency data and all suggestions have frequency >0, TRUE.\r\n - If the instance of SolrSpellChecker returns frequency data and any suggestion have frequency == 0, FALSE.\r\n - If the instance of SolrSpellChecker returns NO frequency data but has suggestions, OMIT.\r\n - If the instance of SolrSpellChecker returns NO suggestions, FALSE. \r\n\r\nPossibly this isn't fully accurate but I'm at least mostly correct here.

I'm guessing the code here uses the presence or absence of frequency data as kind of a proxy indicator whether or not its dealing with IndexBasedSpellChecker or FileBasedSpellChecker.  Possibly it would be better if each instance of SolrSpellChecker had a \"isCorrectlySpelled()\" method that toNamedList() could call?
