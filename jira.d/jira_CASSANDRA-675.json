Rao","active":true},"body":"The attached patch fixes 2 problems.\r\n\r\n1. TcpReader.read() has to go through a set of protocols (header, content, etc) to fully read a message. If the socket doesn't have enough bytes to read to produce a full message, a ReadNotCompleteException is thrown. This exception is then handled by TcpReader.read() and if the socket has new bytes to read, TcpReader.read() resumes from the protocol that's left last time. It seems that this exception handling can take at least 1-2ms. The patch converts exception to a normal return with a special value. \r\n\r\nI still don't quite understand why exception handling in java is so expensive though. Note that just pre-allocating ReadNotCompleteException itself (which I thought is where most of the overhead came from) doesn't help. Throwing exception has to be completely avoided.\r\n\r\n2. Change Selector.select(1) to Selector.select() and wake up the selector every time that the interest bit of a selectionkey needs to be changed. Without this change, it could take up to 1ms for the interest bit to be registered with the selector.\r\n\r\nHere are some performance results of reading a column with a 4k value (average response time in ms for local weak reads, the old quorum read w/o this patch, the new quorum reads with this patch). With the patch, quorum reads are 3X-6X faster.\r\n\r\nthreads local_weak_read old_quorum_read new_quorum_read\r\n1\t0.71974982\t9.546683881\t2.002089927\r\n2\t0.919307311\t12.34252153\t1.966206096\r\n4\t1.018249762\t18.62889817\t2.243343764\r\n8\t1.136501263\t25.49487977\t3.213168828\r\n16\t1.796865109\t29.8252928\t5.889078686\r\n32\t3.60204913\t40.44861522\t11.65799948\r\n\r\nThis patch also has a minor change to TCP streaming.
