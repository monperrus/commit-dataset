that modify things in here could interfere with other tests because its not a per-jvm sandbox like TEMP_DIR, and its definitely not per-test.\r\n\r\nBottom line: I think really the best solution is that tests that want to write files to their configuration area should create a temporary directory (via our normal tempdir mechanism) and write to that...
