I changed the factory class to use the same approach as the embedded driver, as it seemed to be easier to use reflection because of the mix between pre-JDBC 4.0 classes and JDBC 4.0 classes.\r\nThe patch also removes the workaround (disabling) in DataSourceReferenceTest.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if the method behaves as documented. I don't think it will ever return null, but either succeed or throw an exception.
