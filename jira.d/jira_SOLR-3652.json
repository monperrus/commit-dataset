Looking at the patch, this seems to just raise an exception with large numbers, not actually support them. \r\n\r\nThere isn't actually a problem with \"large\" numbers -- the real problem is actually with \"small\" numbers -- specifically the root cause of the infinite looping was when the \"gap\" was too small, _relative to the the start/end_, for the field type in use (float), and became effectively the same as \"zero\".  \r\n\r\nThat's what this patch fixes.  If adding the gap to the lower bound of a range produces a value that is still equal to the lower bound, it fails rather the going into an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nbq. Would it be possible to support large ranges? \r\n\r\nlarge ranges can work fine -- use a \"big\" gap and you will never see this problem.  what doesn't work is having a range so small that for the field type being used, the lower and upper bounds are equivalent for some values.\r\n\r\nbq.  ...could that tie me over until the behaviour is actually fixed? Or is it a limitation with sig figs, and not the absolute value?\r\n\r\nThis is really a fundamental limitation based on the underlying data types being used.  If you use a \"float\" field type in Solr, the underlying representation is constrained by the valid values that can be represented by a java Float.  likewise for \"double\" ...\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Float.html\r\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html\r\n\r\n...if your field type is \"float\" and you ask for something like {{facet.range.start=100000000000&facet.range.end=100000086200&facet.range.gap=2160}}} then eventually, as FacetComponent computes the individual ranges, it's going to try and compute a range where the lower bound is \"9.9999998E10\" -- but for float values, \"9.9999998E10 + 2160 = 9.9999998E10\" and that's where the infinite loop underflow error check will abort the request.  There's really nothing else it can do.\r\n\r\nIf you try the same request with a \"double\" field or a \"long\" field and everything will work fine for this particular example, but a java \"float\" can't express a difference between \"9.9999998E10\" and \"9.9999998E10 + 2160\"\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2012-07-24T23:58:04.281+0000","updated":"2012-07-24T23:58:04.281+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599559/comment/13421894","id":"13421894","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 1365363. - trunk\r\nCommitted revision 1365365. - 4x\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2012-07-25T00:30:18.558+0000","updated":"2012-07-25T00:30:18.558+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599559/comment/13421985","id":"13421985","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=njakobsen","name":"njakobsen","emailAddress":"nicholas dot jakobsen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nicholas Jakobsen","active":true},"body":"Ah, I see, it's a problem of scale between the range and the gap.
