the [paper|http://www.dc.fi.udc.es/~barreiro/publications/blanco_barreiro_ecir2007.pdf] that we used as a reference is buggy itself :) or at least misleading.\r\n\r\nFormula 1 that supposedly gives the Robertson-Sparck-Jones normalization of idf should really read (according to [its authors|http://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk/publications/rtlo_DIRpaper.pdf]:\r\n{code}\r\nIDF = log ( ((D - df) + 0.5) / (df + 0.5) )\r\n\r\n  or: IDF = - log ( (df + 0.5) / ((D - df) + 0.5) )\r\n{code}\r\nAs it's presented in the Blanco-Barreiro paper it would be invalid (for some values the argument to log() would be negative).\r\n\r\nAt this point I wasn't sure about the Formula 2 in Blanco-Barreiro, because going by the definition it should be a difference between the observed IDF - that is, the one that is calculated in Formula 1 - and an expected estimate based on a Poisson model, denoted as expIDF. Whereas the Formula 2 seemed different... After searching the literature for a while I found [another paper|http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/downloads/publications/2007/48920155.pdf] by Murray-Renals where a formula for RIDF is presented clearly enough for math-challenged people like me:\r\n{code}\r\nexpIDF = - log ( 1 - e^(-totalFreq/D) )\r\nRIDF = IDF - expIDF\r\n{code}\r\nSo, to summarize, the Formula 2 in the Blanco-Barreiro paper should look something like this:\r\n{code}\r\nRIDF = log(((D - df) + 0.5) / (df + 0.5)) + log( 1 - e^(-totalFreq/D) )\r\n\r\n   or: RIDF = -log((df + 0.5) / ((D - df) + 0.5)) + log( 1 - e^(-totalFreq/D) )\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nNow, comparing to the original formula from the Blanco-Barreiro paper we can clearly see that it is similar, but it differs in the way it calculates IDF:\r\n{code}\r\nRIDF = - log(df/D) + log(1 - e^(-totalFreq/D))       (Formula 2)\r\n{code}\r\nWhich means that even though they mention the Robertson-Sparck-Jones normalization they don't use it (and neither do Murray and Renals in their paper).\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I think the Formula 2 is correct, and our code has to be fixed. Patch is coming shortly, I need to write a unit test.\r\n(Edit: links were broken)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ab","name":"ab","emailAddress":"ab at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrzej Bialecki ","active":true},"created":"2012-03-29T18:20:31.818+0000","updated":"2012-03-29T18:21:59.676+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548637/comment/13241612","id":"13241612","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ab","name":"ab","emailAddress":"ab at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrzej Bialecki ","active":true},"body":"Patch that fixes the issue.
