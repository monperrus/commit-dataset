However there is a use of old commons-math (2.2) lurking:\r\n\r\ncore/src/main/java/org/apache/mahout/classifier/sgd/TPrior.java:\r\nimport org.apache.commons.math.special.Gamma;\r\n\r\nThis happens to have worked since commons-math has been pulled in by hadoop-common. But it no longer is in HEAD:\r\n\r\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/common/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/pom.xml?view=markup\r\n\r\nSo this will no longer compile against the latest Hadoop. I believe it will also not actually run again the latest Hadoop, even if one were to use a version compiled versus older Hadoop 2, since the class that uses it is used in the context of Writables -- that is, outside the client environment that might happen to have packaged commons-math -- and so would fail on the cluster.\r\n\r\nThe change is trivial, to import the commons-math3 class. I've verified that tests pass and a patch is attached.\r\n\r\nQuestion is how much of a 'blocker' this should be for the pending release. It would cause it to stop working with the next Hadoop 2 release, so would be useful to get in, IMHO.\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"368232","summary":"Accidental use of commons-math won't work with next Hadoop 2 release","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":"2014-01-24","customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":3,"total":3,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688958/comment/13871782","id":"13871782","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=smarthi","name":"smarthi","emailAddress":"smarthi at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Suneel Marthi","active":true},"body":"Sean, I think we should be able to get this into 0.9 release.
