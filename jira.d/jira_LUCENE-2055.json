stemmer proudly lists that it implements the snowball algorithm, but it is not correct.\r\nit is my understanding that such problems (buggy stemming impls) are the reason the snowball project was created in the first place\r\n\r\nSo, we can fix the bug in 2 different ways:\r\n* delete the old stemmers and in the analyzers replace them with SnowballStemFilters (it does fix the bug, as they now become correct)\r\n* keep the buggy code and behavior with version\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir

non-english user to use lucene. \r\nLet's take the romanian case, sure its supported by SnowballAnalyzer, but:\r\n* where are the stopwords? if the user is smart enough they can google this and find savoy's list... but it contains some stray nouns that should not be in there, and will they get the encoding correct?\r\n* for some languages: french, dutch, turkish: we already want to do something different already. For french we need the elision filter to tokenize correctly, for dutch, the special dictionary-based exclusions (I have been told by some any stemmer that does not handle fiets correct is useless), for turkish we need the special lowercasing.\r\n* for other languages: german, swedish, ... i think we REALLY want to implement decompounding support in the future. For german at least, there is a public domain wordlist just itching to be used for this.\r\n* oh yeah, and all the javadocs are in english, so writing your own analyzer is another barrier to entry.\r\n\r\nSo I think instead its best to have a \"recommended default\" organized by language, preferably one we have relevance tested / or is already published. many of the existing snowball stemmers have published relevance results available already, thus my bias towards them. Sure it won't meet everyones needs, and users should still think about using them as a template, but I think digging up your own stoplist / writing your own analyzer, figuring out your language support is really buried in snowball, combined with documentation not in your native tongue, i think this adds up to a barrier to entry that is simply too high.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2010-02-01T09:56:29.545+0000","updated":"2010-02-01T09:56:29.545+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12440420/comment/12828071","id":"12828071","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Several bugs:\r\n- StemOverrideFilter should be final or have final incrementToken()\r\n- The usage of mixed CharArraySet and a conventional dictionary map is buggy.
