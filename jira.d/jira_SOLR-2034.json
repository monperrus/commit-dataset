same moment) would still have a functioning system.\r\n\r\nAs i recall, the BinaryResponseWriter / Parser use a version param and version metadata in the response (just like the XmlResponseWriter) to indicate the codec version requested and the code version returned -- this seems like the kind of thing that should probably warrant a new coden impl with a new version number.\r\n\r\nthat said: i didn't follow the details of the binary response writer / parser / codec implementation very closely, so i have no idea how hard it will be to make it all work smoothly for people: if it's a pain in the ass then i'm totally fine with saying that SolrJ 3.x can't talk to Solr 1.x (and vice versa) ... but we should still probably update the binary code version info to make it clear there is a difference","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot

helpful).\r\n\r\nultimately the goal would be to make it easier for non-java clients to implement this protocol. although the wiki says only the java client implements this, i found an issue for the .NET client here: http://code.google.com/p/solrnet/issues/detail?id=71\r\n\r\nI took a look at the github source code (http://github.com/mausch/SolrNet/blob/javabin/SolrNet/Impl/JavaBinCodec.cs) and
