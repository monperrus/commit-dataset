FacetsCollector is stateless in the sense that it doesn't \\*remember\\* if it computed the results already or not. Why do you call it multiple times? Usually the usage is to compute FacetResult once, then use it wherever you need it. We could make FacetsCollector behave e.g. like TopDocsCollector, where after you call topDocs() once, it drains its PQ and the subsequent calls fail (or returns an empty TopDocs). In either case, the Collector doesn't remember the returned result. Therefore I suggest that you modify your code to call it only once.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2013-03-30T14:34:15.301+0000","updated":"2013-03-30T14:34:15.301+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639923/comment/13618088","id":"13618088","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"I think we should throw an exception if you call it again?
