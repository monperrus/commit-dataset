This was not the behaviour of CommonsHttpSolrServer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've tracked it down to a line (271 in 3.6.0) in HttpSolrServer.java which is:\r\n  entity.addPart(name, new StringBody(value));\r\n\r\nThe problem is that StringBody(String text) maps to \r\n  StringBody(text, \"text/plain\", null);\r\nand in \r\n  StringBody(String text, String mimeType, Charset charset)\r\nwe have this piece of code:\r\n  if (charset == null) {\r\n     charset = Charset.forName(\"US-ASCII\");\r\n  }\r\n  this.content = text.getBytes(charset.name());\r\n  this.charset = charset;\r\nSo unless charset is set everything is converted to US-ASCII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in CommonsHttpSolrServer.java (line 310 in 3.6.0) there is this line\r\n  parts.add(new StringPart(p, v, \"UTF-8\"));\r\nwhich adds everything as UTF-8.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simple solution would be to change the faulty line in HttpSolrServer.java to\r\n  entity.addPart(name, new StringBody(value,Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\")));\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't work either since my tests have shown that neither Jetty or Tomcat recognizes the strings as UTF-8 but interprets them as 8-bit (8859-1 I guess).\r\n\r\nSo changing HttpSolrServer.java to\r\n  entity.addPart(name, new StringBody(value,Charset.forName(\"ISO-8859-1\")));\r\nactually gives me the same result as using CommonsHttpSolrServer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut my investigations have shown that there is a difference in how Commons-HttpClient and HttpClient-4.x works.\r\nCommons-HttpClient sends all parameters as regular POST parameters but URLEncoded (/update/extract?param1=value&param2=value2) while\r\nHttpClient-4.x sends them as multipart/form-data messages and I think that the problem is that each multipart-message should have its own charset parameter.\r\n\r\nI.e HttpClient-4.x sends \r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n--jNljZ3jE1sHG529HrzSjZWYEad-6Wu\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data;

HttpSolrServer on the other hand sends everything as different parts in a multipart-post, one part for each parameter.\r\n\r\nRegarding fixing HttpSolrServer, I've tested the two solutions I previously described and both seems to work but might have totally different implications.\r\n\r\nFirst solution is to change HttpSolrServer.java so \r\n{code} \r\nentity.addPart(name, new StringBody(value));\r\n{code} \r\nis changed to\r\n{code} \r\nentity.addPart(name, new StringBody(value, \"text/plain\", Charset.forName(\"ISO-8859-1\")));\r\n{code} \r\nWhat implications this might have I'm not sure, it might be wrong according to some standard to assume 8859-1 and it doesn't solve this problem universally. But both the dist-Jetty and my Tomcat(7.0.22) work with this fix.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond solution is a more generic fix.\r\nThis involves the same change as the previous, except the charset is \"UTF-8\".\r\n{code} \r\nentity.addPart(name, new StringBody(value, \"text/plain\", Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\")));\r\n{code} \r\nBut it also involves getting the guys developing HttpClient to make a change.\r\nCurrently their code looks like this\r\n{code:title=HttpMultiPart.java}\r\n  String filename = part.getBody().getFilename();\r\n  if (filename != null) {\r\n    MinimalField ct = part.getHeader().getField(MIME.CONTENT_TYPE);\r\n    writeField(ct, this.charset, out);\r\n  }\r\n{code}\r\nIf they would change their code to not only add Content-Type when there is a filename, but always do it.\r\nTogether with the fix in HttpSolrServer.java that would make sure that UTF-8 encoded strings always would be sent to the server.\r\nBut this requires them to make a change...\r\n\r\n\r\nA third option would be to get HttpClient to post just like Commons-HttpClient did, i.e no multipart posting, but what that might require in terms of work I have no idea","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hson","name":"hson","emailAddress":"roger dot hakansson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Roger Håkansson","active":true},"created":"2012-04-18T23:25:25.239+0000","updated":"2012-04-18T23:25:25.239+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12551510/comment/13257081","id":"13257081","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hson","name":"hson","emailAddress":"roger dot hakansson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Roger Håkansson","active":true},"body":"Uploaded network dumps which shows difference between CommonsHttpSolrServer and HttpSolrServer","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hson","name":"hson","emailAddress":"roger dot hakansson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Roger Håkansson","active":true},"created":"2012-04-18T23:27:05.126+0000","updated":"2012-04-18T23:27:05.126+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12551510/comment/13257305","id":"13257305","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=siren","name":"siren","emailAddress":"ssiren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=siren&avatarId=11533","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=siren&avatarId=11533","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=siren&avatarId=11533","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=siren&avatarId=11533"},"displayName":"Sami Siren","active":true},"body":"Thanks Roger for the detailed report.
