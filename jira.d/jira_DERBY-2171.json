Thus when I read this list I don't get the impression that these are issues I should care about. However when reading the detail I do see it is an issue that I should care about.\n\nFor example:\n\nFrom bullet list.\n\"263 - Client should throw not implemented exception for depricated setUnicodeStream/getUnicodeStream\"\n\nSays to me there is an outstanding bug in 10.2 where the client is throwing an exception it should not.\nBut the actual issue that will affect an application is well described by the statement problem statement in the section for 253\n\n\"PreparedStatement.setUnicodeStream() and ResultSet.getUnicodeStream() throw SQLException when invoked after upgrading to Apache Derby 10.2.\"\n\nSeems like that would be the better text to be put in the bullet list.\n\nLooking at the detailed notes for the issues the text in Problem sometimes describes something that is a good thing, not a Problem.\nE.g. 781, is it a problem Derby now performs a hash-join, if so why was it changed? (and 1357)\n\nSome that describe a Problem (e..g. 721,1130,1295,1314,1384,1652) are actually describing a problem that no longer exists in 10.2, but I thought this section was about issues that existed in 10.2. In these cases the Symptom text tends to describe the \"problem\" better. Ie. the problem is that the code behaviour has changed, not the old bug.\n\nI don't understand why these are considered issues though: 668, 1621 - they seem to be fixed bugs.\n\n253, 1857, 822 are good examples to follow (except for the one liner in the bullet list)\n\nAlso maybe there could be some text that explains what ISSUES are. :-) Something along the lines of applications upgrading to 10.2 or using Derby for the first time should be aware of these issues.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"40251","summary":"Issues section of RELEASE-NOTES is confusing","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310090":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12310050":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":5,"total":5,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12358556/comment/12458261","id":"12458261","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"body":"The detailed entry for 1652 is confusing, hard to understand if the problem still exists or has been fixed.\r\nIn the Solution section just says a fix is available in 10.1 and 10.2 (so why is it in the issues section then?)\r\nand then has a incomplete sentence \"thrown now\".","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"created":"2006-12-13T20:50:37.000+0000","updated":"2006-12-13T20:50:37.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12358556/comment/12459415","id":"12459415","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Committed derby-2171-v01.diff at subversion revision 488358.
