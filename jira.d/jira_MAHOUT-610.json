This causes problems as CoocurencesMapper sometimes emits rowpairs in the first form and sometimes in the second form thus separating the cooccurences. If I'm right, this is due to the fact that ordering of the WeightedCoocurrenceArray for one column isn't guaranteed to be the same as for another column.\r\nThe solution is very simple, either you can change the compare method of the RowPair class or you can adapt the CooccurencesMapper to enforce that RowA < RowB.\r\n\r\nHope I've not missed something obvious, and that this is intended behavior.

Thank you very much for this. \r\n\r\nI'm only wondering why all the tests that use RowSimilarityJob internally always worked. My guess is that's because CooccurrencesMapper implicitly relies on the weightedOccurrences in its weightedOccurrenceArray being sorted by row ascending. If we only run the M/R code as a local hadoop job, this might be the case because it's the natural order in which the weightedOccurrences are mapped out. As you already said there's no ordering guarantee in a really distributed environment. I will run some verification tests for this later this week and than I'll commit your fix.
