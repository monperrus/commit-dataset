But for other use cases of AnalyzerWrapper I have to use global strategy or the one of a wrapped analyzer). It looks like the current impl in AnalyzerWrapper is somehow assuming you want to wrap per field.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to make it mandatory in Lucene trunk, and add the missing ctor in Lucene 4.x, too. The default one should be deprecated with a hint that it might be a bad idea to use this default.\r\n\r\nMy use case is:\r\nI have lots of predefined Analyzers for several languages or functionality in my search application. I have some additional AnalyzerWrappers around that simply turn any other analyzer into a phonetic one or ASCIIFolding one (so I can use that with another field). So, my wrapper just takes one of these per-language Analyzers and wraps with another additional TokenFilter. As the underlying Analyzer is global reuse, I need to make the wrapper global, too - currently impossible. Per field is a waste of resources in this case.\r\n\r\nOnly PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper should use PerField strategy hardcoded (as it is per field), the base class not!\r\n\r\nSo I would suggest to make the base class AnalyzerWrapper copy the ctor of the superclass Analyzer and deprecate the default ctor in 4.x. For my above example (to wrap another analyzer), I still need the resuse strategy of the inner analyzer, so I need set getter on Analyzer.java, too (see current patch).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-08-13T11:57:22.424+0000","updated":"2013-08-13T11:58:56.476+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663384/comment/13738120","id":"13738120","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"{quote}\r\nI would suggest to make it mandatory in Lucene trunk, and add the missing ctor in Lucene 4.x, too.
