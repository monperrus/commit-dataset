Maybe there is a way to add the schema prefix to the key. That would help distinguish two different users who have created views against the same foreign database. That would make me feel more comfortable about closing the connection when the tool is unloaded. Thanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2013-12-30T21:56:21.648+0000","updated":"2013-12-30T21:56:21.648+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12686188/comment/14013716","id":"14013716","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Resolving this issue. There is a remaining issue raised by Knut: Should something be done to explicitly close the connection when it is removed from the HashMap. If the external connection is a connection to another Derby database, then I would expect that its resources would be released when the no-longer referenced connection is garbage collected. Behavior for other databases may vary but I would expect garbage collection would clean up resources for connections to other databases too. If someone is not satisfied with this response, feel free to open a follow-on issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2014-05-30T14:52:34.617+0000","updated":"2014-05-30T14:52:34.617+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12686188/comment/14164296","id":"14164296","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"reopening for backport to 10.10.  temp assigning myself while working on it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2014-10-08T22:28:43.180+0000","updated":"2014-10-08T22:28:43.180+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12686188/comment/14165806","id":"14165806","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"body":"Commit 1630596 from mikem@apache.org in branch 'code/branches/10.10'\r\n[ https://svn.apache.org/r1630596 ]\r\n\r\nDERBY-6440: Drop connection to foreign database when foreignViews optional tool is unloaded.\r\n\r\nbackported change #1553269 from trunk to 10.10 branch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"created":"2014-10-09T21:44:30.090+0000","updated":"2014-10-09T21:44:30.090+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12686188/comment/14167200","id":"14167200","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"backported to 10.10 and resolving.  resetting original owner.
