The fact that it is used to populate in 'getNaturalEndpoints' made me unsure.\r\n\r\n2) No. This could be addressed by making 'TMD.pendingRanges' a ConcurrentMap (preferred) or by synchronizing SS.calculatePendingRanges().  I suppose this doesn't address the fact that the contents could change while whoever called getPendingRanges() is using the data, but that we had that problem before.\r\n\r\n3)  StorageService owns it.  I had a hard time following this at first too.  Every reference to TMD can trace it's roots back to the one created in SS.  TMD is *so close* to being a singleton.  I can't remember why I changed calculatePendingRanges() to retrieve it from the ARS instead of grabbing the SS member though.\r\n\r\n4) What if I change this so that the message becomes: \"send me bootstrap data for this list of tables\" instead of: \"for each table, send me bootstrap data.\"?  Then, as soon as a remote node is finished, it can send an indication and the bootstrapping node can remove the remote node from it's bootstrap set.  It seems like that would solve CASSANDRA-673 at the same time, correct?\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gdusbabek","name":"gdusbabek","emailAddress":"gdusbabek at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070"},"displayName":"Gary Dusbabek","active":true},"created":"2010-01-13T02:56:17.613+0000","updated":"2010-01-13T02:56:17.613+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12442910/comment/12799744","id":"12799744","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jaakko","name":"jaakko","emailAddress":"rosvopaallikko at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jaakko Laine","active":true},"body":"\r\n(1) ARS.replica_ cannot be used for this purpose as it might be different for two instances of same replication strategy.

If somebody was still using the old pending ranges, let them do so.

Many of the methods that now accept a 'table' parameter get that parameter from a call to DD.getNonSystemTables().
