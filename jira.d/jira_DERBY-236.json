So changes made to  RunTest to pass on the encryption, testEncryptionAlgorithm values to the MultiTest harness. Also changed mtTestCase to recognize the encryption properties and modify the database url to use for the MultiTest.\r\n-- ran derbyall on jdk142 with no failures\r\n-- verified that encryption run for stress.multi was running ok, by adding keepfiles=true to encryptionAll.properties and checking the service.properties for all the databases created as part of this encryptionAll testrun.
