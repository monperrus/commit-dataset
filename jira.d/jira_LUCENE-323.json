Use a custom similarity to eliminate all tf and idf effects, just to \nisolate what is being tested.\n  2.  Create two documents doc1 and doc2, each with two fields title and \ndescription.  doc1 has \"elephant\" in title and \"elephant\" in description.  \ndoc2 has \"elephant\" in title and \"albino\" in description.\n  3.  Express query for \"albino elephant\" against both fields.\nProblems:\n      a.  MultiFieldQueryParser won't recognize either document as containing \nboth terms, due to the way it expands the query across fields.\n      b.  Expressing query as \"title:albino description:albino title:elephant \ndescription:elephant\" will score both documents equivalently, since each \nmatches two query terms.\n  4.  Comparison to MaxDisjunctionQuery and my method for expanding queries \nacross fields.  Using notation that () represents a BooleanQuery and ( | ) \nrepresents a MaxDisjunctionQuery, \"albino elephant\" expands to:\n        ( (title:albino | description:albino)\n          (title:elephant | description:elephant) )\nThis will recognize that doc2 has both terms matched while doc1 only has 1 \nterm matched, score doc2 over doc1.\n\nRefinement note:  the actual expansion for \"albino query\" that I use is:\n        ( (title:albino | description:albino)~0.1\n          (title:elephant | description:elephant)~0.1 )\nThis causes the score of each MaxDisjunctionQuery to be the score of highest \nscoring MDQ subclause plus 0.1 times the sum of the scores of the other MDQ \nsubclauses.  Thus, doc1 gets some credit for also having \"elephant\" in the \ndescription but only 1/10 as much as doc2 gets for covering another query term \nin its description.  If doc3 has \"elephant\" in title and both \"albino\" \nand \"elephant\" in the description, then with the actual refined expansion, it \ngets the highest score of all (whereas with pure max, without the 0.1, it \nwould get the same score as doc2).\n\nIn real apps, tf's and idf's also come into play of course, but can affect \nthese either way (i.e., mitigate this fundamental problem or exacerbate it).","customfield_10010":32674.0,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"27726","summary":"[PATCH] MultiFieldQueryParser and BooleanQuery do not provide adequate support for queries across multiple fields","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuck%40manawiz.com","name":"chuck@manawiz.com","emailAddress":"chuck at manawiz dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuck Williams","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuck%40manawiz.com","name":"chuck@manawiz.com","emailAddress":"chuck at manawiz dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuck Williams","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Operating System: Windows XP\nPlatform: PC","customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":27,"total":27,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12314473/comment/12322058","id":"12322058","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuck%40manawiz.com","name":"chuck@manawiz.com","emailAddress":"chuck at manawiz dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuck Williams","active":true},"body":"Created an attachment (id=13747)\r\nTest case to demonstrate problem, and fix to fix it.\r\n\r\nRun TestQuery with Lucene on classpath.

is that MaxDisjunctionScorer uses bubble sort to keep the subscorer\r\nsorted over the documents in the next() method (line 103), and this does not scale nicely\r\nwhen the number of subscorers increases.\r\nSupposing the number of subscores that match the document is N,\r\nthe amount of work to be done is proportional to (N*N) per document.\r\nIn DisjunctionSumScorer a priority queue is used, and there the amount of work is\r\nproportional to (N log(N)) per document.\r\nSo I would recommend to rewrite MaxDisjunctionScorer to inherit from a new common\r\nsuper class with DisjunctionSumScorer, sharing everything except the\r\nadvanceAfterCurrent() method (which could be abstract in the new superclass).\r\nIt's possible to be more aggressive in refactoring by initializing and adapting\r\nthe score per index document using different methods, but this would take N\r\nextra method calls per document.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the name could be changed to DisjunctionMaxScorer\r\nfor consistency in the org.lucene.search package.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPaul

The initial sort is done with Arrays.sort() which is O(n*logn).  The incremental resort is O(k*n) where k is the number of clauses that match the document last generated.  Even if n is large, k will usually be small.  Theoretically this is O(n^2) because k could be as high as n, but this is extremely unlikely especially when n is large.    More likely is that k is bounded by a small constant, in which case the algorithm is O(n).  It's like Quicksort in that regard -- there are outlier cases where it won't perform well, but it will perform better than most alternatives for the vast majority of cases.\r\n\r\nResorting the whole list every time would perform worse.  The best algorithm would probably be to use the standard insert and delete operations on a heap (as in heap sort):\r\n\r\n    while top element generated last doc\r\n        heap remove it\r\n        generate it\r\n        heap insert it\r\n\r\nThis would yield total time O(k*logn), as with a PriorityQueue.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is much of an issue to worry about, but the algorithm could be revised to use the heap sort operations if others think it is important.\r\n\r\nChuck\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=manawiz","name":"manawiz","emailAddress":"chuck at manawiz dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuck Williams","active":true},"created":"2005-11-15T07:55:22.000+0000","updated":"2005-11-15T07:55:22.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12314473/comment/12357721","id":"12357721","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl","name":"paul.elschot@xs4all.nl","emailAddress":"paul dot j dot elschot at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180"},"displayName":"Paul Elschot","active":true},"body":"The ScorerDocQueue.java here has a single operation for something\r\nvery similar to the heap-remove/generate/heap-insert:\r\n\r\nhttp://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-365\r\n\r\nThere is also a test class for testing performance of disjunction scorers\r\nwhich could be used to find out which k is big enough to warrant the use\r\nof a heap (priority queue).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPaul Elschot\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl","name":"paul.elschot@xs4all.nl","emailAddress":"paul dot j dot elschot at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180"},"displayName":"Paul Elschot","active":true},"created":"2005-11-16T04:12:46.000+0000","updated":"2005-11-16T04:12:46.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12314473/comment/12357806","id":"12357806","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"Added Iterable to DisjunctionMaxQuery as a semi Java5 friendly way to iterate over the disjuncts.

This reduces the time per next() to O(k*log(n)) instead of O(k*n) per Paul's earlier comment.  Most of the class changed, so I included both a patch and the new class.  This is only lightly tested; the junit test passes, along with the entire Lucene test suite.  I'm not working on the project anymore that led to the original class and so have not tested it on that.  I'm working on a new project that will use this and so it will get thoroughly tested there, but am not yet to an appropriate point.  I thought it was best to post the patch now as I believe it is correct and the unit test does pass.  Perhaps others would like to try it out.  E.g., it would be interesting to run the performance test that Paul mentions.\r\n\r\nAlso, I found and fixed another bug while updating the class.  In the current committed version, there is a problem if skipTo() exhausts all the scorers.  It did not set more to false, and so a subsequent call to next() would attempt to access the non-existent first scorer.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to get some form of DistributingMultiFieldQueryParser in so that this is easy to use.\r\n\r\nThanks to Yonik for committing this functionality!\r\n\r\nChuck\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=manawiz","name":"manawiz","emailAddress":"chuck at manawiz dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuck Williams","active":true},"created":"2005-11-30T12:43:06.000+0000","updated":"2005-11-30T12:43:06.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12314473/comment/12360275","id":"12360275","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the changes Chuck!\r\n\r\nYour patch was backwards, BTW :-)\r\n\r\nI haven't had a chance to run any benchmarks, but I committed this because it also fixes a bug.\r\nSince it also looks like the uses of /2 and *2 were all unsigned, I replaced them with shifts.
