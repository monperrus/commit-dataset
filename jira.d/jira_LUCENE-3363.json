I tested removing this too and replacing it with det + removeDead + reduce, but it slowed down regex parsing considerably, so I think we should continue to use minimize here.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I optimized wildcardquery here to use the optimized concatenate() to avoid useless determinize() calls when the LHS is a string, before it was using the concatenate(List) method.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2011-08-08T14:43:04.001+0000","updated":"2011-08-08T14:43:04.001+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12518048/comment/13080985","id":"13080985","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"by the way, for whatever reason the seed never OOM'ed for me, but:\r\nbefore:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\njunit-sequential:\r\n    [junit] Testsuite: org.apache.lucene.index.TestTermsEnum2\r\n    [junit] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 211.474 sec\r\n    [junit] \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n{noformat}\r\njunit-sequential:\r\n    [junit] Testsuite: org.apache.lucene.index.TestTermsEnum2\r\n    [junit] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.856 sec\r\n    [junit] \r\n{noformat}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2011-08-08T14:54:44.883+0000","updated":"2011-08-08T14:54:44.883+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12518048/comment/13081005","id":"13081005","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"here is the quote from the original hopcroft paper, explaining why this crazy test that uses lots of random unicode strings causes the blowup:\r\n\r\nAn algorithm is given for minimizing the number of states in a finite automaton or for\r\ndetermining if two finite automata are equivalent.
