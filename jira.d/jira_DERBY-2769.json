I will run tests and check that in.\r\n\r\n\r\nClob.java\r\n\r\nremove import  org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.Util;\r\n       This is unused and may bring engine code into the client which is not good.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the condition below there are a few issues:\r\nif (offset + len > str.length()) {\r\n            throw new SqlException(agent_.logWriter_,\r\n                    new ClientMessageId(\r\n                            SQLState.LANG_SUBSTR_START_OR_LEN_OUT_OF_RANGE),\r\n                    new Integer(offset), new Integer(len));\r\n        }\r\n\r\nEven though we are sharing a SQLState with  SQLState.LANG_SUBSTR_START_OR_LEN_OUT_OF_RANGE we need a new message, because the existing one, \"The second or third argument of the SUBSTR function is out of range.\" doesn't make sense in this context and doesn't take parameters.  I think the way to do this is add a new constant to SQLState.java with value \"22011.S.1\", then add that message to messages.xml. The message should be something like: \"The range specified for the substring with offset {0} and len {1} is not valid\".  There is another step too when adding SQLState messages to the client.  They have to be added to java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/splitmessages.java to get picked up by the client build. Otherwise it will just print UNKOWN MESSAGE. After making the changes, you may want to verify them manually or temporarily print out the message in your JUnit test to make sure it all worked.  Unfortunately our JUnit tests just check SQLState so can miss issues with message text.\r\n\r\n\r\nClobTest.java\r\nThere is a comment         \r\n//if offset + len == str.length(), it's accepted.\r\nI think this is incorrect and the test case below it useds str.length() -1\r\n\r\nEmbedClob.java \r\nAgain we should use a new message instead of LANG_SUBSTR_START_OR_LEN_OUT_OF_RANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the new checking causes some cases that used to execute to now fail with client. For example I found I could execute setString(1,\"goodbye\",2,6) where the offset + len  were greater than the length of the string before the change, but not after. I think the changes are ok but we should probably have a release note.\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2009-04-22T22:30:50.374+0000","updated":"2009-04-22T22:30:50.374+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12371026/comment/12702887","id":"12702887","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yunlee","name":"yunlee","emailAddress":"yun dot lee dot bj at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yun Lee","active":true},"body":"Kathey, thanks for your advice.
