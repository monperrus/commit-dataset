The context manager will unwind the contexts during cleanup in the reverse order they were placed in the global stack.  \r\n\r\nIn ContextManager.cleanupOnError(), \r\n-- A non StandardException (a jvm error) gets mapped to NO_APPLICABLE_SEVERITY here:\r\n\t\t\tint errorSeverity = error instanceof StandardException ?\r\n\t\t\t\t((StandardException) error).getSeverity() :\r\n\t\t\t\tExceptionSeverity.NO_APPLICABLE_SEVERITY;\r\n\r\n-- Next, we walk down the stack calling cleanup on each context as long as if we reached the lastHandler or if we have reached end of stack. \r\n\r\nSo if a given context is the last handler for an error of some severity, then we stop there and do not call cleanup on the context's below it.\r\n\r\nThe derby1707 repro debugging shows that in this case  - at prepare time for the statement, a NPE is thrown from GenericStatement.prepMinion. In the context stack,store contexts are first cleaned up and then the SC cleanup is called. Note: LCC is below in the stack and LCC cleanup does not get called since the SC.isLastHandler returns true.\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n-- isLastHandler for GenericStatement is not right. JVM errors severity gets mapped to NO_APPLICABLE_SEVERITY in \r\nContextManager.cleanupOnError().  Thus on cleanup, for JVM error SC.isLastHandler can return true for some cases(when rollbackParentContext is false, and inUse is true).  This is incorrect because for JVM errors, it is necessary to let the outer contexts know and take necessary corrective action.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis patch makes the following changes:\r\n1. Make change to GenericStatementContext.isLastHandler() so it will return false for JVM errors thus allowing the outer contexts to take corrective action.\r\n2. Store transaction context treats JVM errors as session severity. To ensure consistency, map severity for non StandardException instances to be SESSION_SEVERITY in GenericLanguageContext, and GenericStatementContext. \r\n\r\nThere is an existing DERBY-1528 which also results in a npe and then the raw store protocol violation error. With this change, if you run the repro (repro1528_npe), instead of a raw store protocol violation error, you will get a java.sql.SQLException 'No current exception'\r\n\r\nRan derbyall on ibm142/linux ok with 2 expected failures unrelated to this change. (NSInSameJVM and blobclob4BLOB)\r\n\r\nI have been using the derby1707 repro without the fix for this jira for testing purposes.  Are there any suggestions on how best to add a test for this case. One way is to simulate a java error using debug flags but I dont like that approach.  Suggestions welcome.  I can make the yet-to-be-fixed derby1528 repro as a test,but that will no longer test this fix when we eventually fix derby-1528.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at this patch. I am new to this area, so would appreciate more eyes on this patch.  Thanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=skambha","name":"skambha","emailAddress":"ksunithaghm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunitha Kambhampati","active":true},"created":"2006-09-28T14:53:53.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-28T14:53:53.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348278/comment/12438464","id":"12438464","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"body":"Patch looks good, I don't think there needs to be a test here.
