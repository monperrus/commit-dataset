It seems to me that this method could be supported but we'd create the input stream on the fly via extending InputSource and doing the work in the getter.  We don't want to create the stream if nobody calls it (even if we know that our particular consumer happens to call it and close it).  Apparently the caller of the getInputStream is supposed to close it so perhaps this means we don't even need to close it in the Config constructor since the doc builder parse() method will.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2010-05-14T21:05:21.139+0000","updated":"2010-05-14T21:05:21.139+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443314/comment/12888541","id":"12888541","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=joachimm%40yahoo.com","name":"joachimm@yahoo.com","emailAddress":"joachimm at yahoo dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joachim Martin","active":true},"body":"I'm having a similar problem with using XInclude to import a transformers.js script file in DataImportHandler:\r\n\r\n    <script xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\">\r\n        <xi:include parse=\"text\" href=\"file:transformers.js\"/>\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\nAt runtime, the XML parser looks for this in my solr directory, not parallel to my db-data-config.xml (in the core/conf directory).\r\n\r\nHaving the source for script transformers in a separate js file allows me to use an IDE to check syntax, etc- very helpful.\r\n\r\n[I'm assuming this is the same problem, but not sure]","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=joachimm%40yahoo.com","name":"joachimm@yahoo.com","emailAddress":"joachimm at yahoo dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joachim Martin","active":true},"created":"2010-07-14T21:12:39.955+0000","updated":"2010-07-14T21:14:25.132+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443314/comment/12982339","id":"12982339","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"It would be really nice to get this into the next version (3.x).

I think that's perfectly fine to preserve the SystemID along with the InputStream.\r\n\r\nProblem is that the XML handling is a little bit inconsistent, because it currently only work for files and only if the files are in exact same directory. Theoretically, it *should* be possible that a XML file that is in the conf folder (which is part of the classpath) can load a file from the lib folder (which is also part of the resource classpath and should work with a relative filename only path) or even from inside a JAR file (if the java package name == classpath directory is identical).\r\n\r\nThis could only be solved by e.g. supplying a method RessourceLoader.asFooBarResolver that returns a class that implements both org.xml.sax.EntityResolver, javax.xml.transform.URIResolver (to work with either SAX and TRAX) and delegates all requests to the underlying classloader. Example could be taken from [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipentres.html] (warning: this example is not correct, but goes into right direction).\r\n\r\nAnother solution might be to not pass streams around, but simply feed the xml parser with the URL.toString() returned by ClassLoader.getResource().

With this patch everything compiles and tests and resolves correctly, but plugins using old methods may fail (needs review).\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nThe system identifier is no longer a plain filename with path, it gets initialized using a custom URI scheme \"solrres:\". This scheme is resolved using the EntityResolver that utilizes SolrResourceLoader. As long as somebody only gives relative URLs in XIncludes or anywhere else (this is also extendable to other places, not only xinclude, e.g. external XML entities inside XSLs, config of DIH,...), the files are staying using this scheme and are resolved by the custom EntityResolver. As soon as scheme changes, the default resolver is used.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the good thing is, that somebody can still use absolute filesystem URLs or even external URLs in the xincludes, by using full schemed URIs like file:///my/absolute/path.\r\n\r\nOther places in Solr that load XML and support Xinclude must also changed to this, currently almost every place where solr loads XML files from ResourceLoader using InputStreams are broken.\r\n\r\nQuestionable is also backwards compatibibility. Ideally there should be a loadResourceAsInputSource() method in ResourceLoader so DIH can also use it, which would also break backwards (interface!).\r\n\r\nThis patch is currently only for review about the idea.
