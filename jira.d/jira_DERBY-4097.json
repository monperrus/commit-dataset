There's no real need for batch update in the failing test case. I wrote it, and I think I used batch update because I was struggling with some networking issues at that time (high latency on local connections) so that batch update was much faster.\r\n\r\nRemoving the use of batch update is one alternative to expose the real error. However, that will change the timing and may hide this failure if it is timing-sensitive. Another alternative is to add a wrapper around executeBatch() and call getException() in the test. I have also noticed that in embedded mode, the underlying exception is available with getCause() and is therefore reported by JUnit, whereas the client driver (where we see this problem now) does not do that. So a third option is to make the client driver report these errors the same way as the embedded driver.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2009-03-16T16:50:52.207+0000","updated":"2009-03-16T16:50:52.207+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416964/comment/12682380","id":"12682380","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Good insight on the getCause() interaction with JUnit -- it would be great if there was\r\nsomething simple we could do to make the client exceptions more automatically visible\r\nto generic software such as JUnit that knows how to unwind getCause but doesn't\r\nknow about the DBMS-specific exception chaining techniques.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2009-03-16T17:17:25.025+0000","updated":"2009-03-16T17:17:25.025+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416964/comment/12682477","id":"12682477","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Here's a patch that makes the client driver use initCause() on BatchUpdateExceptions, like the embedded driver already does.

This is an intended feature of the current implementation, I think.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of alternatives:\r\n\r\n* comparePreviousRecord() could release its latches and return RESCAN_REQUIRED when it detects a WaitError\r\n\r\n* A reimplementation of the nullable unique constraint insert code has been suggested [1] and it would probably fix this issue. Then the test would fail intermittently for a while, but it may be possible to rewrite the test to prevent it. (I think we could turn off auto-commit and run the test in one transaction. Then there won't be post-commit work done in parallel with the execution of the test, and I think it will still expose the bug that it was supposed to expose, but I would have to test that to be sure.)\r\n\r\n[1] <URL:http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-dev/200903.mbox/%3C49AEBA96.5010609@sbcglobal.net%3E> ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2009-03-18T21:50:50.792+0000","updated":"2009-03-18T21:50:50.792+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416964/comment/12700148","id":"12700148","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"> I think we could turn off auto-commit and run the test in one\r\n> transaction.

This is not an ideal solution, as the thread that gets the WaitError may need many tries before it manages to latch the left sibling, and it will be constantly spending CPU until it manages to acquire the latch. Anyways, it should not happen very frequently, and I think a spin-wait loop is better than failing in this situation.
