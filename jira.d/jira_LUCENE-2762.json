At that point you have 1X due to\r\nstarting segments (which cannot be deleted until commit), another 1X\r\ndue to the segments created by the prior merge (now being merged),\r\nanother 1X by the newly merged single segment, and a final 1X from the\r\nfinal CFS.  In this worst case that means we require 3X of your index\r\nsize in temporary space.\r\n\r\nIn other cases we use less disk space (the NRT case).\r\n\r\nAnd of course if CFS is off there's no change to the temp disk space.\r\n\r\nI've noted this in the javadocs and will add to CHANGES...\r\n\r\nBut... I think we should improve our default MP.  First, maybe we\r\nshould set a maxMergeMB by default?  Because immense merges cause all\r\nsorts of problems, and, likely are not going to impact search perf.\r\nSecond, I think if a newly merged segment will be more than X% of the\r\nindex, I think we should leave it in non-compound-file format even if\r\n\"useCompoundFile\" is enabled...
