The latter thread after each iteration, checks the EigenStatus to see if it's still \"inProgress()\", which the first thread sets to false when it's done.  Unfortunately, I don't think even that is being done correctly, if you look at how it's done, it's not synchronizing on a proper final lock object.  \r\n\r\nSo while yes, removing the lock on the boolean is correct, it reminds me that the way thread synchronization was coded (by me), it appears to have been done completely  unsafely.  As it turns out, the synchronization in practice is between two different threads who only make checks once every couple 10's of seconds up to once every 10's of minutes (depending on the data set), and so collisions on updating a single reference are basically infinitessimal.
