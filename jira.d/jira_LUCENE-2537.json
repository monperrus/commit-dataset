Apparently, there's a long standing bug against SUN since May 2006 (http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6431344) that's still open and reports the exact same behavior that I'm seeing.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, this might be a Windows limitation and is expected to work well on Linux. I'll give it a try. But this makes me think if we should keep the current behavior for Linux-based directories, and fallback to the chunks approach for Windows ones? Since eventually I'll be running on Linux, I don't want to lose performance ...\r\n\r\nThis isn't the first that we've witnessed the \"write once, run everywhere\" misconception of Java :). I'm thinking if in general we should have a Windows/Linux FSDirectory impl, or handlers, to prepare for future cases as well. Mike already started this with LUCENE-2500 (DirectIOLinuxDirectory). Instead of writing a Directory, perhaps we could have a handler object or something, or a generic LinuxDirectory that impls some stuff the 'linux' way. In FSDirectory we already have code which detects the OS and JRE used to decide between Simple, NIO and MMAP Directories ...\r\n{quote}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2010-07-13T19:06:15.598+0000","updated":"2010-07-22T12:09:01.722+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12469184/comment/12891120","id":"12891120","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"I wrote a test which compares FileChannel API to intermediate buffer copies.

The estimated amount of work is the length copied. This means that if abort() is called, it might take a tad longer until CFW will detect it.\r\nI don't think it's serious, since (1) abort() is not called often, (2) for small segments this will probably have no effect (OneMerge was accessed roughly every ~2MB copied) and (3) as reported, the optimized copy is faster when using FileChannel, therefore the time that passes between checks may not be that long.\r\nAnd there's a (4) -- for really large segments, the amount of work done to merge them is far larger than copying them into the CFS. Therefore the chances that abort() will be called during that process is relatively small ...\r\n\r\nAll tests pass.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2010-07-23T12:45:09.167+0000","updated":"2010-07-23T12:45:09.167+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12469184/comment/12892073","id":"12892073","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"If there are no objections, I'll commit this today,","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2010-07-25T05:58:02.708+0000","updated":"2010-07-25T05:58:02.708+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12469184/comment/12892203","id":"12892203","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 979161 (3x).\r\nCommitted revision 979185.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2010-07-26T07:25:23.951+0000","updated":"2010-07-26T07:25:23.951+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12469184/comment/13013311","id":"13013311","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"body":"Bulk close for 3.1","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"created":"2011-03-30T15:49:56.880+0000","updated":"2011-03-30T15:49:56.880+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-2537/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04pz3:"}}
