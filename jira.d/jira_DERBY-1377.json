The corresponding derby-1377-v01.status lists the files touched. This adds copyright headers to the sql scripts used by the tests. My tests now run cleanly on 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 using the Sun vms. However, I think there may need to be some mop up on the ibm vms and on the jsr169 platform. Would appreciate it if someone could run the tests on those platforms and check in the outlier canons.\r\n\r\nThe test run on 1.3 failed for me because of a ClassNotFound issue. Since I'm working on a new laptop, I may have some environmental issue here. Or the 1.3 tests may be broken now for other reasons. It is hard to imagine these headers introducing this problem. It would be good if someone else could try out the 1.3 tests. Thanks.\r\n\r\nThanks again to Andrew for the script.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2006-10-25T22:31:10.000+0000","updated":"2006-10-25T22:31:10.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343964/comment/12444938","id":"12444938","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"body":"I believe the SQL scripts under nist should not have the Apache Licence header, since they are actually under the public domain.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"created":"2006-10-26T17:54:36.000+0000","updated":"2006-10-26T17:54:36.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343964/comment/12444959","id":"12444959","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Ported 467793 from trunk to 10.2 branch at subversion revision 478087.\r\n\r\nI will scrub the copyright headers from the nist tests and canons next.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2006-10-26T18:41:49.000+0000","updated":"2006-10-26T18:41:49.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343964/comment/12444968","id":"12444968","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Committed derby-1377-v02-nist.diff at subversion revision 468102.
