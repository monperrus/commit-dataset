get_range_slices.\r\n\r\nIndexClause only has a start key for get_indexed_slices, but it would seem that the reasoning behind using 'KeyRange' for get_range_slices applies there as well, since if you know the range you care about in the primary index, you don't want to continue scanning until you exhaust 'count' (or the cluster).\r\n\r\nSince it would appear that get_indexed_slices would benefit from a KeyRange, why not smash get_(range|indexed)_slices together, and make IndexClause an optional field on KeyRange?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot
