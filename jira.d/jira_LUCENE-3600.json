I think there is still a problem with the assert on a single segment with one parent and child. I just took your test case: testAdvanceSingleParentSingleChild and it fails for me with asserts enabled on the \"assert prevParentDoc >= parentDoc;\" (I copied over the code, having problems with Lucene IDEA project config now...).\r\n\r\nImagine there is a single parent and single child. Child is docId 0, and parent is docId 1. A filter for the parent is used in conjunction with the child query. The parent filter is used first, and returns docId 1, which then the BlockJoinQuery advance is called. But, because its the first parent, this call: \"final int prevParentDoc = parentBits.prevSetBit(parentTarget - 1);\" will cause -1 to be returned, which will cause this assert: \"assert prevParentDoc >= parentDoc;\" to fail (parentDoc is 0). Just removing the assert fixes the problem.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimchy","name":"kimchy","emailAddress":"kimchy at mac dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shay Banon","active":true},"created":"2011-11-28T08:37:59.507+0000","updated":"2011-11-28T08:37:59.507+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12532826/comment/13158698","id":"13158698","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Shay, maybe you missed copying over init'ing parentDoc to -1?
