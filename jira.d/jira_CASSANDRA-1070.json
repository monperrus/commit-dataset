ClockRelationship?\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThat's because version clocks can be disjoint (but timestamp clocks don't). \r\nI admit, without version clock in the patch, it may feel weird. This is one of those \r\n\"this patch is a step before the next patch from 580\". \r\nAnd I've decided to remove the DISJOINT case from ClockRelationship enum from \r\nthis patch because having it will require the addition of the notion of reconcilier, but this \r\nseems beyond this patch to me.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n... but more importantly doesn't\r\n\r\n           IClock oldClock = atomic.getAndSet(newClock);\r\n\r\ntemporarily set the reference to the new value (even it is smaller than the old), before fixing it to be the max?  that would be a bug.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIt do look like a bug (but maybe Kelvin could also comment on this one).

But for\r\ndeserialization, we would need somehow to write that on disk. I see two\r\noptions (at least two simple):\r\n 1) we use the 2 bytes used for the deletion & expiration flags. Feels a bit\r\n like a hack though. \r\n 2) we add a new field in the serialized form of the column.\r\nAnd the superColumn serializer would also need to know the clock type to\r\ndeserialize the markedDeletedAt field. Here we can't use any existing flags.\r\nOverall, it seems to me like a waste of perfectly good cpu cycles and space\r\njust to avoid having an argument to a function (not a lot, granted, but still). \r\nUnless ... I'm not completely awaken yet and I miss something much easier.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slebresne","name":"slebresne","emailAddress":"sylvain
