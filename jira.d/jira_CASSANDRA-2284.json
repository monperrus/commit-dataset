I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect, but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.\r\n\r\nBut there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there, fine, I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore. My humble opinion though.
