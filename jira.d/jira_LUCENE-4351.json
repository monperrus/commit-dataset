Many were trivial, like GeohashUtils and ParseUtils moving to the .io. package, or SimpleSpatialContext being just SpatialContext now.  The biggest change was circle.getRadius() and DistanceCalculator.distance() being degrees based.  Chris and I thought it best that Lucene spatial retain distance unit neutrality, and hence the distance ValueSource out of the SpatialStrategy is in degrees as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, I modified the complex TestRecursivePrefixTreeStrategy.geohashRecursiveRandom() test to use circular data clusters instead of rectangular, since at the poles those rectangles don't look too rectangular ;-)  May not have been strictly necessary as part of the patch but while debugging an unknown failure I wanted to make this improvement.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2012-09-04T15:55:07.827+0000","updated":"2012-09-04T15:55:07.827+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605921/comment/13448929","id":"13448929","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sstults","name":"sstults","emailAddress":"sstults at opensourceconnections dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Scott Stults","active":true},"body":"Updated the Eclipse classpath entry","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sstults","name":"sstults","emailAddress":"sstults at opensourceconnections dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Scott Stults","active":true},"created":"2012-09-05T17:57:29.473+0000","updated":"2012-09-05T17:57:29.473+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605921/comment/13448968","id":"13448968","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"Thanks Scott.\r\nI committed to trunk in 4 commits: 1381230, 34, 58, 79.
