With the improved diagnostics, I found in the log that one of the threads failed with the expected deadlock exception, and the other thread failed with a timeout exception. So it seems like the difference between the deadlock timeout and the regular wait timeout is too small on this platform. The deadlock is detected, as expected, but the chosen victim is not terminated quickly enough to prevent the other transaction from timing out.\r\n\r\nSince this test case is not expected to produce a timeout, I think we can increase the lock timeout without slowing it down in the common case. That should give slower machines more time to kill the victim before the timeout expires. Faster machines don't need to wait for the timeout to happen, so they should be unaffected.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-11-22T11:00:28.578+0000","updated":"2012-11-22T11:00:28.578+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617075/comment/13502750","id":"13502750","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attaching d6001-2a-waitTimeout.diff which increases the wait timeout for testDeadlockTimeout to 60 seconds. The test still completes in just a few seconds, as the higher timeout just gives it a larger window, it doesn't require the test to use the entire available time slot.\r\n\r\nSince the test now uses different timeout values for testLockTimeout and testDeadlockTimeout, I also reduced the wait timeout for the former test case to speed it up. That test case is single-threaded and not timing sensitive, so reducing the timeout should not reduce the chance of success.\r\n\r\nI also reduced the deadlock timeout for testDeadlockTimeout to 1 second, as it is the difference between the wait timeout and the deadlock timeout that's determining the chance of success, not the size of the deadlock timeout. So we could just as well keep it short to make the test complete faster (even if it's just one second faster).\r\n\r\nI'm running the test in a loop on one of the machines where I've seen the problem (successfully so far).
