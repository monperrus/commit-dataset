The test needed here would be very simple.  It would need a sequence file \r\nwith test data.  This could be created at runtime from synthetic data or could be in the test resources\r\ndirectory.  Then the test would run through the data several times picking a small number of seeds\r\nfrom this data file and recording whether the last vector in the input appears in the sample.  If the\r\ninput sample is large-ish (say 10,000 vectors) and the sample small (10 or so), then the last vector\r\nshould only appear in the sample rarely (1/1000 times).  With the bug as you assert it, the last vector\r\nwould be in the sample with very high probability.\r\n\r\nIf you add up the number of times the last few vectors appear in the sample, you should\r\neither get a small number (correct) or a big number (incorrect).  This should be a very\r\nsensitive test.\r\n\r\nI don't have time to do this.  Do you?  It would really help the projet to get this right.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tdunning","name":"tdunning","emailAddress":"ted dot dunning at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Dunning","active":true},"created":"2012-12-20T14:57:54.568+0000","updated":"2012-12-20T14:57:54.568+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12624816/comment/13537080","id":"13537080","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrey.davydov","name":"andrey.davydov","emailAddress":"andrey dot davydov at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrey Davydov","active":true},"body":"I found this bug while I worked with 6500 vectors sample and I want to generate 30 initial clusters.
