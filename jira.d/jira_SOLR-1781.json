The `bad` node created several new index.[0-9] directories, even with this patch, and caused high I/O. I deleted the complete data directory so also the index.properties file. It loaded its index from the other nodes and no longer created many index dirs.\r\n\r\nThanks","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markus17","name":"markus17","emailAddress":"markus at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831"},"displayName":"Markus Jelsma","active":true},"created":"2012-07-23T08:05:06.789+0000","updated":"2012-07-23T08:05:06.789+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12456787/comment/13421323","id":"13421323","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markus17","name":"markus17","emailAddress":"markus at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831"},"displayName":"Markus Jelsma","active":true},"body":"One of the nodes ended up with two index directories today.

For brief periods, more than once can exist...it should just end up being cleaned up when no longer in use.\r\n\r\nI can try and dig in some more, but I'll have to think a little - I don't really know where to start.\r\n\r\nMy test for this issue is a test that runs a lot of instances and randomly starts and stop them. I then monitor the index directories for these 6-12 instances - I run these tests for a long time and monitor that each keeps ending up with one index dir. At some points, there are two indexes - but it always drops to one shortly later.\r\n\r\nSo there still may be some hole, but I don't know where or how.\r\n\r\nIf you look in the logs, perhaps you will see a bunch of \"Unable to delete directory : \" entries? It might be that it's trying but cannot. It might make sense to start using deleteOnExit as a last resort if delete fails - I just looked and the del call in SnapPuller does not do this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2012-07-24T17:20:01.609+0000","updated":"2012-07-24T17:20:01.609+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12456787/comment/13421565","id":"13421565","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markus17","name":"markus17","emailAddress":"markus at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831"},"displayName":"Markus Jelsma","active":true},"body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI've deleted both today and yesterday indexes of more than a few hours old.\r\n\r\nSome are being removed indeed and some persist.
