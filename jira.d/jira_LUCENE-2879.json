without it.\r\n\r\nA small thing that bothered me was that an explanation is created although the user did not call explain(), and in general explain() is considered slower, but it is called once per query, so it should not be a perf issue, and that's the case already for two other queries so anyhow this one (MFQ) should first be made consistent, which is done by this patch.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that the implementation of a similar logic in SpanWeight is more compact:\r\n{code:title=SpanWeight: calls extractTerms()}\r\nterms=new HashSet<Term>();\r\nquery.extractTerms(terms);\r\nidfExp = similarity.idfExplain(terms, searcher);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nBut doing the same in MFQ would change its logic, as it would consider each term only once. \r\nNot saying that the patch should change, just pointing out the difference in sum-of-square-weights computation between SpanWeight and MFQ.\r\nBoolean Query fore example, would iterate over its sub queries and sum theirs, and so, if it so happens that the same term appears in two descendant queries that term would contribute twice to the sum. In this sense, MFQ and BQ behave similarly, both differ from SpanQuery... well I guess this falls to the \"black magic\" area :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"created":"2011-01-23T13:32:55.868+0000","updated":"2011-01-23T13:32:55.868+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12496421/comment/12985332","id":"12985332","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"{quote}\r\nA small thing that bothered me was that an explanation is created although the user did not call explain(), and in general explain() is considered slower, but it is called once per query, so it should not be a perf issue, and that's the case already for two other queries so anyhow this one (MFQ) should first be made consistent, which is done by this patch.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nWell, this IDFExplanation is confusing/tricky... so with a good implementation, its an abstract class so creating the \"Explanation\" does nothing really.\r\n\r\nInstead the explanation is calculated \"lazily\", only if you ask for it:\r\n{noformat}\r\n    /**\r\n     * This should be calculated lazily if possible.\r\n     * \r\n     * @return the explanation for the idf factor.\r\n     */\r\n    public abstract String explain();\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nNot saying that the patch should change, just pointing out the difference in sum-of-square-weights computation between SpanWeight and MFQ.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI saw this and it bothered me a bit as well too.
