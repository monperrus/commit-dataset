But, it does seem a bit dubious to rely on any particular ordering behavior for a Hashtable, and if we're talking about the behavior of BackingStoreHashtable, then it is also worth mentioning that the underlying Hashtable was recently changed to a HashMap.\r\n\r\nI'm also a bit confused about the fact that the old harness test reliably reproduced the behavior, whereas the new JUnit one does not, and the fact that I cannot reproduce the failure that the nightlies see. Also, from the failure in the nightlies, it appears that the row order is not being reversed after all. It was expecting the first reversed row, but getting the next row in order (103) instead. I'm curious if the rows are now coming back in order, or if perhaps some improvement in memory usage is allowing us to stash one extra row in memory.\r\n\r\nShould we just remove this testcase?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"created":"2007-04-13T00:16:28.506+0000","updated":"2007-04-13T00:16:28.506+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12367115/comment/12488712","id":"12488712","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"body":"This test relies on the setting of a static property, derby.language.maxMemoryPerTable, which explains why it would always pass when run alone, but fail for others when run as part of a suite.

Seems that the different behavior is here. When i run the suite where updateCursor is the first test in test list , it gets the correct value from Optimizer.MAX_MEMORY_PER_TABLE. When i run the suite that fails the boot() method gets a null. The boot() method is called once.\r\n\r\ncan updateCursor() suceeds only if it is the first test to run ??\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matra","name":"matra","emailAddress":"umatrangolo at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ugo Matrangolo","active":true},"created":"2007-04-13T21:52:58.545+0000","updated":"2007-04-13T21:52:58.545+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-2543/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i071qf:"}}
