InsertResultSet collects generated keys even in the case where there are no auto-generated keys. This is unnecessary, and causes problems when overflowing to a heap conglomerate since heap conglomerates don't support zero-sized rows. It should stop doing this.\r\n\r\n2. On re-execution of a PreparedStatement that was created with RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS, InsertResultSet will collect all columns, not only key columns. This is because InsertResultSet only calculates the key columns on the first execution, but it doesn't cache the result, so on re-execution it will be null, which the code interprets as all columns. This makes the temporary row holder take up more space than necessary. One odd effect of this problem is that it cancels problem (1) on re-execution. That is, if you call executeUpdate() on a PS and get the \"Conglomerate could not be created\" error mentioned in the bug description, calling executeUpdate() again on the same PS will succeed. It succeeds the second time because then it adds all inserted columns to the temporary row holder, and therefore doesn't hit the problem with zero-length rows. Of course, it should add the same set of columns to the temporary row holder regardless of how many times the PS is executed, so this should be fixed together with problem (1).\r\n\r\n3. As Kristian noted, getGeneratedKeys() is supposed to return an empty ResultSet if no keys were generated, but it returns a ResultSet with one row. This is because the collected set of keys is discarded by getGeneratedKeys() and instead the result of VALUES IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL() is returned. I believe this part of the problem will be handled by DERBY-3609, and does not need to be tackled in this issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2013-10-30T15:01:03.265+0000","updated":"2013-10-30T15:01:03.265+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595258/comment/13809221","id":"13809221","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attaching derby-5823-2a.diff which tackles problem 1 and 2 mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIt skips adding rows to the temporary row holder if there are no columns to add. This means the row holder will never overflow to disk if there are no generated keys, so there will be no attempt to create a heap conglomerate with zero-length rows, and the \"Conglomerate could not be created\" error is avoided.\r\n\r\nIt also keeps the set of key columns between executions so that we avoid the overhead of collecting all columns for all inserted rows on re-execution. In addition to avoiding overhead, this also ensures that the internal result set that holds the generated keys (InsertResultSet.autoGeneratedKeysResultSet) has the correct shape.

Cache the array of generated key columns between executions. In the\r\n   existing code, the array of key columns was created only on the\r\n   first execution. Since it wasn't cached, it was null on all\r\n   subsequent executions. When it is null, all columns are collected\r\n   into the temporary row holder, which wastes space. Now, only the\r\n   key columns are collected, also on re-execution.\r\n\r\nThe test case was contributed by Kristian Waagan.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"created":"2013-11-01T10:31:29.354+0000","updated":"2013-11-01T10:31:29.354+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595258/comment/13812791","id":"13812791","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"body":"Commit 1538572 from [~knutanders] in branch 'code/branches/10.10'\r\n[ https://svn.apache.org/r1538572 ]\r\n\r\nDERBY-5823: Multi-row insert fails on table without generated keys with RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS\r\n\r\nMerged revision 1537888 from trunk.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"created":"2013-11-04T12:08:57.191+0000","updated":"2013-11-04T12:08:57.191+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595258/comment/14284726","id":"14284726","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"bulk change to close all issues resolved but not closed and not changed since June 1, 2014.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2015-01-21T00:22:59.709+0000","updated":"2015-01-21T00:22:59.709+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-5823/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06f2v:"}}
