one presumes).\r\n\r\n3) Node starts and tries to participate in ClusterName \"B\", but has a very hard time of it because it is configured to participate in cluster \"A\". \"Bad things\" happen.\r\n\r\nRequested behavior : \r\n\r\n1) Node from ClusterName \"A\" stops.\r\n\r\n2) storage-conf.xml gets new ClusterName \"B\"\r\n\r\n3) Node notices that the node already has configuration
