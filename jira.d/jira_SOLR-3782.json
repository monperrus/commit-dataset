The result was that we would send updates from the leader briefly even though there was a new leader.\r\n\r\nI had suspected something similar to this at one point in the hunt and started adding some defensive state checks that we wanted to add anyway. I don't think they caught all of this issue due to the limited tightness one of the state checks can get to (checking the cloudstate leader from a replica against the leader indicated by the request).\r\n\r\nSo the answer is to finally work out how to stop the solr cmd distrib executor - because we need to stop it before closing zkController and giving up our role as leader.\r\n\r\nI've worked that all out and the issue no longer seems to be a problem.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"17485","summary":"A leader going down while updates are coming in can cause shard inconsistency.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":6,"total":6,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12606001/comment/13447644","id":"13447644","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markus17","name":"markus17","emailAddress":"markus at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831"},"displayName":"Markus Jelsma","active":true},"body":"hi - this is in CHANGES but is it resolved?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markus17","name":"markus17","emailAddress":"markus at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831"},"displayName":"Markus Jelsma","active":true},"created":"2012-09-04T12:00:26.406+0000","updated":"2012-09-04T12:00:26.406+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12606001/comment/13447721","id":"13447721","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"I committed a first iteration - I have more refinement/improvement coming.
