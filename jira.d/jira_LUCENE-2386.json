This is a behavioral bw break, which specifically I'm not so sure we should care about, because I wonder how many apps out there rely on being able to open a reader before they ever commited on a fresh new index.

Pros is that I won't need to change many of the tests because they still use the LUCENE_30 version (but that is not a strong argument), so it's a weak Pro.

However, IndexReader.listCommits fails w/ the following exception:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: no segments* file found in org.apache.lucene.store.RAMDirectory@2d262d26: files: []\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos$FindSegmentsFile.run(SegmentInfos.java:652)\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos$FindSegmentsFile.run(SegmentInfos.java:535)\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos.read(SegmentInfos.java:323)\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.DirectoryReader.listCommits(DirectoryReader.java:1033)\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.DirectoryReader.listCommits(DirectoryReader.java:1023)\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.listCommits(IndexReader.java:1341)\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.TestIndexWriter.testNoCommits(TestIndexWriter.java:4966)\r\n       ....\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe failure occurs when SegmentInfos attempts to find segments.gen and fails. So I wonder if I should fix DirectoryReader to catch that exception and simply return an empty Collection .. or I should fix SegmentInfos at this point -- notice the \"files: []\" at the end - I think that by adding a check to the following code (SegmentInfos, line 652) which validates that there were any files before throwing the exception, it'll still work properly and safely (i.e. to detect a problematic Directory). Will need probably to break away from the while loop and I guess fix some other things in upper layers ... therefore I'm not sure if I should not simply catch that exception in DirectoryReader.listCommits w/ proper documentation and be done w/ it.

After some investigation (thanks Robert !), that's the problem: before this change, IW always committed first on an empty directory. It called SegmentInfos.commit(dir), which by a chain of calls ensured the directory exists (in FSDir) by calling file.mkdirs().\r\n\r\nAfter this change, that chain of calls did not happen ... yet somehow tests we still passing for Lucene. Some investigation shows that the Solr tests that failed used SingleInstanceLockFactory, or NoLockFactory. By default, FSDir uses either SimpleFSLF or NativeFSLF. The IW.ctor calls LF.makeLock and obtain, which for these two LFs meant that calling file.mkdirs ... and thus the problem was hidden. SingleInstanceLF and NoLF don't do that !\r\n\r\nSo first, a test which uses FSDir and one of these LFs need to be created, so we catch that problem in Lucene code (this is not related to Solr -- just a missing test in Lucene). Second we need to fix IW ctor, or Dir or whatever.\r\n\r\nI've added that code to IW.ctor, as a sanity check to make sure it works - and indeed all Solr tests pass. So that's one option, even though a bit messy.\r\n{code}\r\ntry {\r\n  directory.createOutput(\"temp\").close();\r\n} finally {\r\n  directory.deleteFile(\"temp\");\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnother option is to add to Directory a prepareForWrite() or simply prepare() which will be called by IW. A default empty impl on Directory, and file.mkdirs on FSDirectory should be enough.\r\n\r\nA third option is to define clear semantics for dir.listAll(), to throw a NoSuchDirectoryException and then change IndexFileDeleter to ignore that exception if OpenMode of IW is CREATE*. It kind of makes sense - if the directory is empty, why bother looking for any index files. Lucene code today already expects that exception to be thrown in SegmentInfos.getCurrentSegmentGeneration -- so we kind of say 'either you use RAMDirectory, or a sub-class of FSDirectory, and then that's what we expect'. So it's not so much of a backwards change ...\r\n\r\nWhile dir.prepare() or prepareForWrite() is very explicit ... it's not protective enough - one can still call listAll w/o calling prepareForWrite (why would you call it if you just want to list files) so I'm not sure which is the best option ... Maybe the last option is the best as at least the caller should not assume anything about the state of the directory. Just prepare to handle the NoSuchDirectoryException, vs. 'there is a directory but it's empty' case.\r\n\r\nI'll revert my commit until this is resolved.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2010-04-11T14:24:43.320+0000","updated":"2010-04-11T14:24:43.320+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461579/comment/12855727","id":"12855727","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 932917 for the revert.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2010-04-11T14:35:46.817+0000","updated":"2010-04-11T14:35:46.817+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461579/comment/12855732","id":"12855732","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"Is this change worth it with all of its repercussions?

Please, read my reference to version control systems and databases - they all leave behind an initialized database if the first commit fails.\r\n\r\nMy point is that the feature is immediately usable and saves people from writing (possibly buggy) emptiness-detection-then-commit code over and over again.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=earwin","name":"earwin","emailAddress":"earwin at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Earwin Burrfoot","active":true},"created":"2010-04-12T09:19:49.795+0000","updated":"2010-04-12T09:19:49.795+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461579/comment/12855924","id":"12855924","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"I don't think that people need to write that \"emptiness-detection-then-commit\" code ... if they care, they can simply immediately call commit() after they open IW.\r\n\r\nbq. Isn't opening IW with CREATE* mode called \"specifically asking for\"?\r\n\r\nIt depends on how you interpret the mode ... for example, you cannot pass OpenMode.APPEND for an empty Directory, because IW throws an exception. The modes are just meant to tell IW how to behave:\r\n* APPEND - I know there is an index in the Directory, and I'd like to append to it.\r\n* CREATE - I don't care if there is an index in the Directory -- create a new one, zeroing out all segments.\r\n* CREATE_OR_APPEND - If there is an index, open it, otherwise create a new one.\r\n\r\nSo if you pass CREATE on an already populated index, IW doesn't do the implicit commit, until you call commit() yourself. But if you pass CREATE on an empty index, IW suddenly calls commit()? That's just an inconsistency that's meant to allow you to open an IR immediately after \"new IW()\" call, irregardless of what was there? And if you open that IR, then if the index was populated you see the previous set of documents, but if it wasn't you see nothing, even though you meant to say \"override what's there\"?\r\n\r\nI've checked what FileOutputStream does, using the following code:\r\n{code}\r\nFile file = new File(\"d:/temp/tmpfile\");\r\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);\r\nfos.write(3);\r\nfos.close();\r\n\t  \r\nfos = new FileOutputStream(file);\r\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\r\nSystem.out.println(fis.read());\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n* Second line creates an empty file immediately, not waiting for close() or flush() -- which resembles the behavior that you're suggesting we should take w/ IW (which is the 'today's behavior')\r\n* Forth line closes the file, flushing and writing the content.\r\n* Fifth line *recreates* the file, empty, again, w/o calling close. So it zeros out the file content immediately, even before you wrote a single piece of byte to it.\r\n* Sixth+Seventh line proves it by attempting to read from the file, and the output printed is -1.\r\n\r\nI've wrapped the FOS w/ a BufferedOS and the behavior is still the same. So I'm trying to show is that we don't fully adhere to the CREATE mode, and rightfully if you ask me - we shouldn't zero out the segments until the application called commit(). But we choose to adhere differently to the CREATE* mode if the index is already populated. That's an inconsistent behavior, at least in my perspective. It's also harder to explain and document, e.g. \"you should call commit() if you used CREATE, in case you want to zero out everything immediately, and the Directory is not empty, but you don't need to call commit() if the directory was empty, Lucene will do it for you.\" -- so now how will the app know if it should call commit()? It will need to write a sort of \"emptiness-detection-then-commit\"?\r\n\r\nI am willing to consider the following semantics:\r\n* APPEND - assumes an index exists and open it.\r\n* CREATE - zeros out everything that's in the directory *immediately*, and also prepares an empty directory.\r\n* CREATE_OR_APPEND - either loads an existing index, or is able to work on the empty directory. No implicit commit is happening by IW if the index does not exist.\r\n\r\nBut I think CREATE is too dangerous, and so I prefer to stick w/ the proposed change to the patch so far -- if you open an index in CREATE*, you should call commit before you can read it. That will adhere to the semantics of what the application wanted, whether it meant to zero out an existing Directory, or create a new one from scratch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2010-04-12T11:26:25.389+0000","updated":"2010-04-12T11:26:25.389+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461579/comment/12855937","id":"12855937","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=earwin","name":"earwin","emailAddress":"earwin at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Earwin Burrfoot","active":true},"body":"bq.
