Of course, these are actually different times!\n\nOf course, if dates are stored in the index with implicit timezone information then not only do we get problems when the clocks go back at the end of summer, but we also have problems crossing timezones.   If a database is created in California and used in Paris then the times are going to be badly skewed (there's a nine hour time difference most of the year).\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"27553","summary":"DateTools needs to use UTC for correct collation,","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jch","name":"jch","emailAddress":"jch at thehaxbys dot co dot uk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Haxby","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jch","name":"jch","emailAddress":"jch at thehaxbys dot co dot uk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Haxby","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"svn trunk at 02-Feb-2005, noon GMT.
