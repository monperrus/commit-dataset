What the patch does is it checks if the optional username and password have specified for the shutdown command and if yes, then it uses protocol level 2 and then sends the username and password info to the server when sending the shutdown command. If user has not specified username and password then it uses protocol level 1 and sends just the shutdown command the way it used to work prior to DERBY-2109. In other words, protocol level 1 for shutdown with no username and password  and protocol level 2 for shutdown with username and password.\r\n\r\nServer on its side checks if it is dealing with protocol level 1 for shutdown and if yes, then it does not need to look for username and password. But if the the protocol level is 2, then the server will expect username and password for the shutdown command,\r\n\r\nThis way, a trunk client with this patch will be able to shutdown a 10.3 server with DERBY-2109 changes with no username and password.

If this command fails because of DRDA_InvalidReplyHead from server, then resend the shutdown command but this time with protocol level 1. The attempt with protocol level 1 will be made only if there was no username and password supplied with the shutdown command. \r\n\r\nOne issue I noticed this with change is if a client with the changes proposed by this patch sends a shutdown command to a 10.3 server(which does not have DERBY-2109 changes) without the username and password, it will get 2 exceptions back from the server. 1st exception will be for sending the shutdown command at protocol level 2 and the 2nd will be for shutting down the server succesfully. Server will also have 2 messages, first indicating that an invalid protocol level command was received and 2nd message saying that the server is shutdown.
