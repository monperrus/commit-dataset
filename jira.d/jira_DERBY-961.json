shrunk to fit\r\nin the column.\r\n\r\nI imagine that the reason for the XX-RESOLVE-XX is\r\nbecause for a SQLBinary data type, the actual value may\r\nnot be human-readable, and so cannot be displayed.\r\n\r\nSo I created the attached experimental diff (tweakMsg.diff),\r\nwhich changes the XX-RESOLVE-XX parameter to the\r\nmessage to \"(Binary data value not displayed)\", which\r\nI hope would give a better hint to the person who received\r\nthis error message about what was going on.\r\n\r\nI ran the entire regression suite with the modified test, and got\r\nno failures, and I also grepped the source tree for XX-RESOLVE-XX\r\nand got no hits.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not totally sure how to make this problem occur,\r\nin order to verify that the new message in fact looks better\r\nthan the old one.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this a complete fix worthy of submitting, I\r\nthink I'll need to find a test case which provokes this error,\r\nand verify that the error message looks better.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, if anybody has any comments on this\r\napproach, I'd be most grateful.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot
