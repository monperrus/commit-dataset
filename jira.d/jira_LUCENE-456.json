underlying IndexSearchers into the final result list (even if there's only one).\r\n\r\nThere's a bug if two documents are compared that don't have the field that is being compared.  If one document doesn't have the field, then it should come first, but if both don't have it, they should be considered equal and the next SortField tried.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation (1.4.3 and head) when both fields are null, one of the two is always chosen as being 'lessThan' the other.  Since this is not consistent (the value of the lessThan depends of the order of the parameters in that case) it changes the sort order (as I observed) and can probably 'confuse' the queue implementation so you get dropped and double hits.\r\n\r\nCould you try to apply the patch I submitted for FieldDocSortedHitQueue and see if that helps in your case too?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lvl","name":"lvl","emailAddress":"lvl at bvdinfo dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luc Vanlerberghe","active":true},"created":"2005-10-17T21:26:07.000+0000","updated":"2005-10-17T21:26:07.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12318013/comment/12332248","id":"12332248","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mseitz","name":"mseitz","emailAddress":"Martin dot Seitz at t-systems dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Martin Seitz","active":true},"body":"The patch doesn't fix the problem.
