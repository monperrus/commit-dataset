As part of our internal memory optimization fixes, we are also planning to migrate to newer version. Research so far brought me to think our best risk-benefit trade off is Lucene 3.6.2. (We are planning to go to the 4.X branch - current development, but that would perhaps come in our own major version upgrade) However, due to this here issue, I would really like to know which version of the core library does not have it? 3.6.1 perhaps? Or 3.5.X?\r\n\r\nAs I understand from your comments, you are not yet planning to provide a fix on the 3.6.X branch - please advise to which version we should migrate where this bug is not present?\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\nVassil Zorev, web developer","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vassil.zorev87","name":"vassil.zorev87","emailAddress":"vassil dot zorev87 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vassil Zorev","active":true},"created":"2013-08-05T08:27:11.370+0000","updated":"2013-08-05T08:27:11.370+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12638481/comment/13729313","id":"13729313","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"body":"this has been fixed in 4.2.1 - I'd recommend to upgrade to the latest 4.x version that is 4.4 at this point.\r\n\r\nsimon","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"created":"2013-08-05T08:56:17.864+0000","updated":"2013-08-05T08:56:17.864+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-4870/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1j19j:"}}
