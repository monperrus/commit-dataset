This patch includes a test case that fails before the patch and succeeds after the patch. All tests pass.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether or not this should be put into the 4.1 release, or held until 4.2. Of course I have the usual programmer's pride and want any of my code included in a release to be as good as I can make it, but I'm also aware of the hazards of including changes like this late in the game. Not sure this will be widely enough used to warrant the risk....\r\n\r\nI don't _think_ there is an infinite loop here (the sleep), but then I always think my code is perfect. I think that if a core fails to load, the finally block will allow other threads to continue. They'll fail also assuming the underlying cause isn't fixed (say the lazily-loaded core configurations are mal-formed XML). But that's not something I think should be addressed in the code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erickerickson","name":"erickerickson","emailAddress":"erickerickson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erick Erickson","active":true},"created":"2013-01-14T03:05:30.874+0000","updated":"2013-01-14T03:05:30.874+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12627353/comment/13554325","id":"13554325","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erickerickson","name":"erickerickson","emailAddress":"erickerickson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erick Erickson","active":true},"body":"OK, I'm going to commit this this evening or tomorrow morning for both trunk, 4.1 & 4.x unless there are objections.
