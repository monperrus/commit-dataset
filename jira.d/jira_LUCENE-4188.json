I could make this method final, and I could add more documentation that makes it clear that the user is free to store the shape in any way they wish since the spatial module doesn't care.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI think it is a misnomer to say this is how we recommend a shape is stored.  That is exactly what I disagree with and why I want it changed from how it is currently.  To me the recommended way, if the consumer already has a String representation of the Shape that they used to construct the Shape, is to just store that String rather than re-parsing the Shape.  I also dont like the use of SpatialContext.  It represents Shapes in a non-standard way, sometimes using WKT (if you're using JtsSpatialContext) and sometimes not.  Yes it is symmetrical with the readShape code, but that is only helpful if you use the Context to read your shapes in the first place.\r\n\r\nThinking about it, I think we need to improve the Shape reading code in SpatialContext so that it is clear what representation is used and so it is possible to extend the functionality when you want to use anything other than Strings.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmale","name":"cmale","emailAddress":"gento0nz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Male","active":true},"created":"2012-07-06T02:58:00.268+0000","updated":"2012-07-06T02:58:00.268+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12597395/comment/13411275","id":"13411275","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"I inlined/removed SpatialStrategy.createStoredField() and added documentation to the SpatialStrategy class header & to createFields() regarding storing a field value.\r\n\r\nCommitted.\r\n\r\nI'll address the rename of createFields() to createIndexableFields() in LUCENE-4192","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2012-07-11T06:32:17.379+0000","updated":"2012-07-11T06:32:17.379+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-4188/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04fu7:"}}
