this code was used at one point to attempt to kick off another jvm to run a server with, but that is now defunct.\nRather than try to make the code work, or try to clean it up, I'd rather spend time converting tests to the junit framework, so I will just fix this up so we don't hit the error.\n\nThe bad code is: \n\t\twshome = jhome.substring(0,jhome.indexOf(sep + \"jre\"));\n\t\twshome = wshome.substring(0,wshome.lastIndexOf(sep));\nIf the jhome ( System.getProperty(\"java.home\")) does not contain 'jre', we will get -1 as the 2nd parameter in jhome.substring, and thus cause the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds.\n\nI propose to fix this piece of code as follows:\n\t\tint havejre=jhome.indexOf(sep + \"jre\");\n\t\tif (havejre > 0)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\twshome = jhome.substring(0,jhome.indexOf(sep + \"jre\"));\n\t\t\twshome = wshome.substring(0,wshome.lastIndexOf(sep));\n\t\t}\n\t\telse\n\t\t\twshome =
