It may be an oversight that getBytes doesn't throw an exception in this case.

The advantage of not having special treatment of getBytes and getString is that the behaviour is easier to explain: LOB columns can only be accessed once. But keeping the special treatment reduces the chances of breaking existing applications, and I don't see any significant downside, so I think I'm leaning towards the approach you chose in the 2a patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-04-20T12:13:49.300+0000","updated":"2012-04-20T12:13:49.300+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12529576/comment/13259535","id":"13259535","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"I committed the test (patch 1b) to trunk with revision 1329186.\r\n\r\nThank you for your opinion, Knut Anders.\r\nBased on your feedback and my own opinion, I will keep the special treatment of getBytes and getString.\r\n\r\nRegarding the suggested refactoring, I will do so to more clearly document the special treatment.
