MappingCharFilter that causes this. Let me explain:\r\n\r\n- With Robert's patch (and also my current fix): read(char[],int,int) and read() both delegate to the underlying charstream.\r\n- With the original CharFilter approach, int read() was not overridden, so the default method in java.io.Reader did the following: allocate char[1], call read(buffer,0,1) -> MappingCharFilters's buffered read method was called. Unfortunately this method is behaving different than MappingCharFilter's one-character read(). And thats the bug here. So neither my code nor Roberts code is to blame, its MappingCharFilter or MockCharFilter that behave different in the two read methods.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-04-16T08:07:55.832+0000","updated":"2012-04-16T08:07:55.832+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12550997/comment/13254583","id":"13254583","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"We should have a asserting method for CharFilter consistency.
