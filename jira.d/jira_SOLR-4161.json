Currently we kind of count on random shutdown issues to interrupt it - it tries to do something that requires an open option and that thing fails.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2012-12-12T00:57:04.621+0000","updated":"2012-12-12T00:57:04.621+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12623196/comment/13529567","id":"13529567","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=commit-tag-bot","name":"commit-tag-bot","emailAddress":"root-jira-commit_tag_bot at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176"},"displayName":"Commit Tag Bot","active":true},"body":"[branch_4x commit] Mark Robert Miller\r\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1420508\r\n\r\nSOLR-4161: add a little more protection\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=commit-tag-bot","name":"commit-tag-bot","emailAddress":"root-jira-commit_tag_bot at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176"},"displayName":"Commit Tag Bot","active":true},"created":"2012-12-12T01:54:52.852+0000","updated":"2012-12-12T01:54:52.852+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-4161/votes","votes":3,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i14hf3:"}}
