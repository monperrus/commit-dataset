I should have scaled it back a little bit to focus on the UI issue, not the java classes.  The title may need changing, and it may require filing another issue.  I see two problems.  With OpenJDK, the file descriptor info and the JVM memory info are not showing on the dashboard.  Side note: I don't have OpenJDK running anywhere and don't have unallocated hardware I can fiddle with right now.\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue is that the user says the file descriptor info is not found in /admin/system output running under OpenJDK, but it is there under Apple or Oracle JVMs.  If the info is available at all from OpenJDK, it may require a code change to get it.\r\n\r\nThe java issue is triggering a javascript issue.  An educated guess is that the code that populates the file descriptor bar is failing and causing the JVM memory bar calculation (JVM memory info is available in /admin/system) to be skipped entirely.  A simple fix for that issue would be to re-order the javascript code so that jvm memory is done before the file descriptor.  A better fix would be to make sure that a nonexistent piece of information doesn't cause problems.\r\n\r\nI'm very weak in both javascript and java reflection, or I would have already tried to come up with patches.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=elyograg","name":"elyograg","emailAddress":"apache at elyograg dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749"},"displayName":"Shawn Heisey","active":true},"created":"2013-03-04T20:09:55.453+0000","updated":"2013-03-04T20:09:55.453+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12635165/comment/13592597","id":"13592597","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=elyograg","name":"elyograg","emailAddress":"apache at elyograg dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749"},"displayName":"Shawn Heisey","active":true},"body":"Additional note from the user on IRC: I adjusted the live server config to run the solr built-in jetty and now all the stats are showing up, even on openjdk, so the issue seems to be with older jetty versions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=elyograg","name":"elyograg","emailAddress":"apache at elyograg dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749"},"displayName":"Shawn Heisey","active":true},"created":"2013-03-04T20:22:10.073+0000","updated":"2013-03-04T20:22:10.073+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12635165/comment/13592616","id":"13592616","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=felixbuenemann","name":"felixbuenemann","emailAddress":"felix dot buenemann at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=felixbuenemann&avatarId=16601","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=felixbuenemann&avatarId=16601","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=felixbuenemann&avatarId=16601","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=felixbuenemann&avatarId=16601"},"displayName":"Felix Buenemann","active":true},"body":"The problem turned out to be jetty6 vs. jetty8 and not OpenJDK.
