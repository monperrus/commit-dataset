They maintain flags (Clock.cleanerRunning and LogToFile.checkpointDaemonCalled) which tell whether serviceNow() has been called, and if they are true, serviceNow() is not called again. When performWork() is called, they reset the flag, allowing others to call serviceNow() again.\n\nHowever, DaemonService.serviceNow() does not guarantee that performWork() always gets called in these cases. Its javadoc says the following:\n\n\t/**\n\t    Service this subscription ASAP.  Does not guarantee that the daemon\n\t\twill actually do anything about it.\n\n\t\t@param clientNumber the number that uniquely identify the client\n\t */\n\nIf one of the calls to serviceNow() does not result in a call to performWork(), the flags which prevent new calls to serviceNow() are not reset. Since both Clock and LogToFile are subscribed to the daemon service in on-demand-only mode, performWork() is only called if the subscriber calls serviceNow(). That means there is no way to reset the flags, and Clock/LogToFile are never allowed to call serviceNow() again.\n\nAlthough BasicDaemon's implementation of the DaemonService interface does in fact give the necessary guarantees (without explicitly stating them, though) to make this protocol work, Clock and LogToFile should be coded against the specification of the interface rather than against the undocumented behaviour of an implementation of the interface.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"39763","summary":"Callers of DaemonService.serviceNow() assume behaviour not guaranteed by the interface","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310090":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12310050":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":4,"total":4,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12382611/comment/12542884","id":"12542884","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"The easiest solution is probably to extend the javadoc comment for\r\nDaemonService.serviceNow() with the necessary guarantee for this code\r\nto work.
