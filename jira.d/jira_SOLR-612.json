It looks like METHOD was really meant to provide a general way of passing non-solr parameters to requests.\r\n\r\nIf we decided that the METHOD is really just HTTP specific and shouldn't be in the general request class -- it's used nowhere but in the HTTP server -- then a significant amount of refactoring will be necessary to implement everything properly. One way to do this would be to introduce a new interface, HttpParameters, and have a subclass for each type of request implement that interface. Then change the HTTP server implementation to only work with requests which implement that interface. This is probably big enough to be handled in a different issue though.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the METHOD could be moved to the HTTP server implementation, making it a property of the server and not of the request. I don't like that option though because different requests have different defaults for the METHOD (e.g. update requests POST, query requests GET) and moving this information requires the server to know how to handle which type of request.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=larsko","name":"larsko","emailAddress":"lars at larsko dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Kotthoff","active":true},"created":"2008-07-15T04:49:10.136+0000","updated":"2008-07-15T04:49:10.136+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399223/comment/12615457","id":"12615457","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"Lars, I've committed your version.\r\nThanks guys!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2008-07-21T22:57:02.089+0000","updated":"2008-07-21T22:57:02.089+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-612/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i03vqv:"}}
