In order to get dblook to generate the DDL for Derby functions, this patch does the following:\r\n\r\n1 - Renames \"impl/tools/dblook/DB_StoredProcedure.java\" to \"impl/tools/dblook/DB_Alias.java\" because that file now handles stored procedures AND functions AND synonyms, all of which are based on the SYSALIASES system catalog.\r\n\r\n2 - Adds logic to new DB_Alias.java file to generate DDL for functions.\r\n\r\n3 - Modifies the \"toString()\" method of the catalog/types/RoutineAliasInfo file to generate a string that is SYNTACTICALLY VALID based on whether an instance of that class is for a PROCEDURE or for a FUNCTION.  The reason this change is required is because the \"ALIASINFO\" column that is returned as part of the SYS.SYSALIASES result set is an instance of RoutineAliasInfo, and thus a call to ResultSet.getString() on the ALIASINFO column ultimately makes a call to RoutineAliasInfo.toString().  That said, the dblook utility makes a \"getString()\" call on the ALIASINFO column and uses the result to generate the corresponding DDL.  Before this patch, the result of the toString() method always corresponded to the PROCEDURE syntax; but now, since dblook is generating DDL for FUNCTIONs, the RoutineAliasInfo.toString() method must recognize if an instance is a PROCEDURE or FUNCTION and return the appropriate syntax.\r\n\r\n4 - Adds test cases for FUNCTIONS to the dblook tests and updates the master files accordingly.\r\n\r\nI ran derbyall with these changes on Windows 2000 with Sun JDK 1.4.2, and all tests passed (except for one failure (testij.java) that is unrelated to my changes).\r\n\r\nNOTE TO COMMITTERS: Because this patch renames an existing file, it's a bit tricky to apply.  I had to copy \"DB_StoredProcedure.java\" to \"DB_Alias.java\" before applying the patch in order to get it to work.  I think Andrew suggested some time ago that a commiter use \"svn move\" to retain the history of the file that has changed names--I tried that, but after I did so the patch wouldn't apply.  So I just copied the file to it's new name, then applied the patch.  But I leave it up to people more familiar with svn to do the right thing here...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2005-06-08T06:40:48.000+0000","updated":"2005-06-08T06:40:48.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12311072/comment/12313102","id":"12313102","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bandaram","name":"bandaram","emailAddress":"bandaram at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Satheesh Bandaram","active":true},"body":"Submitted this patch.
