ranges, and continue to optimize that repair path.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch adds a Predicate that CompactionIterator will apply to the key of each input IteratingRow. Rows that aren't interesting are not added to the set to be reduced. When an IteratingRow is not read, the backing Scanner will seek to the end of the row, so we save a ton of deserialization overhead.\r\n\r\nIn very quick tests, this patch reduced the time to anti-compact out 0.3% of data from 96secs to 30secs. A next step might be to modify CompactionIterator to apply the Predicate to the SSTable index, and only scan certain ranges.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"created":"2009-12-17T07:15:44.191+0000","updated":"2009-12-17T07:15:44.191+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12442671/comment/12792000","id":"12792000","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"Even with maximum possible streaming efficiency I think we still want repair-via-range-command.
