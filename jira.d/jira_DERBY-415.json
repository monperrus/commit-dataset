if you run \"java sysinfo -cp\", then if you have either the jcc driver or the derby\r\n   network client in your classpath, that is treated as success. If you have\r\n   neither driver, then a failure is reporting listing both libraries as failed.\r\n - if you run \"java sysinfo -cp client\", then we assume that you are specifically\r\n   interested in the client JDBC drivers, so we report a failure for either missing\r\n   library. The only way to have success with \"-cp client\" is to have both.\r\n\r\nThis is not exactly what David asked for. In his case, he wanted \"-cp client\"\r\nto treat the case where you have the Derby Network Client, but *not* the JCC\r\ndriver, as a success.\r\n\r\nThis patch behaves that way with plain old \"-cp\", but not with \"-cp client\". My feeling was that if you specifically said \"-cp client\", you wanted to get all the details about the client JDBC library portion of your classpath, so such a person might well care about whether or not the JCC library was found.

Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Here's a short release note to describe the new behavior:\r\n\r\nPROBLEM: Scope of the \"-cp client\" argument to the Sysinfo tool was too broad.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOM: If you run \"java org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo -cp client SimpleApp.class\" you get a message indicating that the DB2 JCC driver was not found in your classpath, even though you have the Derby Client library in your classpath.\r\n\r\nCAUSE: The implementation of the \"-cp client\" argument in the Sysinfo tool was checking for both the Derby Client jar and the DB2 JCC driver jar, and was reporting an error if either jar was missing. Since the Derby Client jar is the preferred client to use, the Sysinfo tool no longer needs to check for the presence of the DB2 JCC driver jar in this case.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION: The implementation of the \"-cp client\" argument has been modified to check only for the presence of the Derby Client jar. To check for the presence of the DB2 JCC driver jar, you can pass the new \"-cp db2driver\" argument.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-08-15T23:54:14.000+0000","updated":"2006-08-15T23:54:14.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12311793/comment/12496127","id":"12496127","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Attaching a releaseNote.html which I ground out of the old-style release note that is included in the comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2007-05-15T20:52:51.435+0000","updated":"2007-05-15T20:52:51.435+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-415/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06srj:"}}
