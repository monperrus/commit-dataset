Blog posts will go\r\n    up, tweets will get tweeted, emails to list or to other lists will\r\n    go unanswered, people doing future Googling will hit these and\r\n    see Lucene as buggy.\r\n\r\n  * We can find our own bugs -- in adding some missing ensureOpens to\r\n    IW, here, I discovered a case where DirectoryReader.close calls\r\n    IW.deleteUnusedFiles after IW was closed, and this invokes the\r\n    DelPolicy, which is definitely dangerous.\r\n\r\nNet/net I think it's important that we try, when possible/reasonable,\r\nto have clear error detection and reporting, making it as easy as we\r\ncan for the user to understand what's wrong.  And if that means a\r\nminiscule extra cost to \"correct\" users, that's a fair tradeoff.\r\n\r\nbq. While a volatile read on (current) x86 is a no-op, it still imposes a happens-before/after restriction via the memory model and hence prevents optimizations across that volatile read. Volatile reads may not always be a no-op on x86 either (and they already aren't on other CPUs).\r\n\r\nThe thing is, we already call ensureOpen only in places where the\r\nadded cost should be vanishingly small compared to what will follow;\r\nit'll still be vanishingly small as a volatile.\r\n\r\nActually, IR's ensureOpen checks the refCount (AtomicLong)\r\nso we are already \"effectively\" volatile for IR, just not for IW.\r\n\r\nbq. Using a volatile also doesn't buy us much either - it's still best-effort (the close could come after we have checked the volatile, but before we have done the read).\r\n\r\nRight this will always be a best effort check, but if we can do a\r\n\"better\" best effort, while still having no real added cost, I think\r\nwe should improve.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying we should add ensureOpen() in hotspots.  But I do think\r\nwe should make IW's closed boolean volatile.  The added cost will\r\nstill be tiny, since we only call ensureOpen where it shouldn't\r\nmatter, and it may allow us to throw ACE instead of a cryptic\r\nexception in some cases.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2011-09-16T19:24:17.659+0000","updated":"2011-09-16T19:24:17.659+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523238/comment/13107895","id":"13107895","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Patch, adding missing ensureOpens, adding volatile to IW's close/closing bools, and fixing the scary bug where we invoke del policy (and possibly delete file) on a closed writer.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2011-09-19T15:16:22.695+0000","updated":"2011-09-19T15:16:22.695+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523238/comment/13157756","id":"13157756","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Bulk close after release of 3.5","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2011-11-27T12:29:26.359+0000","updated":"2011-11-27T12:29:26.359+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-3439/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04kfj:"}}
