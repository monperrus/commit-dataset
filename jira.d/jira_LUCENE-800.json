So if you want to search for a backslash you have to escape it. That means that the first two examples you provides are working as expected:\r\n\r\nitem:\\\\ -> item:\\ is correct\r\nitem:\\\\* -> item:\\* is correct too\r\n\r\nIf you want to search for two backslashes you have to escape both, meaning you have to put four backslashes in the query string:\r\nitem:\\\\\\\\* -> item:\\\\*\r\n\r\n\r\nBut you indeed found two other problems. You are right, the last example should not throw a ParseException. \r\nIn (item:\\\\ item:ABCD\\\\) the queryparser falsely thinks that the closing parenthesis is escaped, but actually the backslash is the escaped character. I will provide a patch for this problem soon.\r\n\r\nAnd as you said the third example should throw a ParseException because there are too many closing parenthesis. There is already a patch for this problem in JIRA: \r\nhttp://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-372\r\n\r\nI will commit fixes for both problems soon. \r\n\r\nThanks again, Dilip!
