Won't getField() get a class cast exception when it encounters a Fieldable that is not a Field?

Searchable was the same kind of thing.  IndexReader is an abstract super class for the different types of readers.  When I did ParallelWriter, I had the same problem and had to introduce Writable since IndexWriter is not an abstract class and ParallelWriter is a different implementation.
