Our update batch is 10 docs, so we are writing about 5000 docs/sec total, using autoCommit to commit the updates (no explicit commits).\r\n\r\nOur environment:\r\n* Solr 4.3.1 w/SOLR-5216 patch.\r\n* Jetty 9, Java 1.7.\r\n* 3 solr instances, 1 per physical server.\r\n* 1 collection.\r\n* 3 shards.\r\n* 2 replicas (each instance is a leader and a replica).\r\n* Soft autoCommit is 1000ms.\r\n* Hard autoCommit is 15000ms.\r\n\r\nAfter about 6 hours of stress-testing this patch, we see many of these stalled transactions (below), and the Solr instances start to see each other as down, flooding our Solr logs with \"Connection Refused\" exceptions, and otherwise no obviously-useful logs that I could see.\r\n\r\nI did notice some stalled transactions on both /select and /update, however.

We've been running SolrCloud since April and we experienced an odd outage today we've never seen before. \r\n\r\nWe are currently running Solr 4.5.1 with 4 slaves and we use CloudSolrServer to send updates. The number of threads went from under 100 to almost 400 in each of the instances in less than one minute. The heap filled up quickly as well until they ran out of memory. It filled about 2GB worth of heap in a couple minutes. Of course, all four JVM started doing major collections one after another but couldn't free any heap memory.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we forgot to take thread dumps in the rush for recovering our site.
