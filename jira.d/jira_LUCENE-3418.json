On digging, I discovered, to my horror, that Lucene is failing to fsync any files, ever!\r\n\r\nThis bug was unfortunately created when we committed LUCENE-2328... that issue added tracking, in FSDir, of which files have been closed but not sync'd, so that when sync is called during IW.commit we only sync those files that haven't already been sync'd.\r\n\r\nThat tracking is done via the FSDir.onIndexOutputClosed callback, called when an FSIndexOutput is closed.  The bug is that we only call it on exception during close:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void close() throws IOException {\r\n      // only close the file if it has not been closed yet\r\n      if (isOpen) {\r\n        boolean success = false;\r\n        try {\r\n          super.close();\r\n          success = true;\r\n        } finally {\r\n          isOpen = false;\r\n          if (!success) {\r\n            try {\r\n              file.close();\r\n              parent.onIndexOutputClosed(this);\r\n            } catch (Throwable t) {\r\n              // Suppress so we don't mask original exception\r\n            }\r\n          } else\r\n            file.close();\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAnd so FSDir thinks no files need syncing when its sync method is called....\r\n\r\nI think instead we should call it up-front; better to over-sync than under-sync.\r\n\r\nThe fix is trivial (move the callback up-front), but I'd love to somehow have a test that can catch such a bad regression in the future.... still I think we can do that test separately and commit this fix first.\r\n\r\nNote that even though LUCENE-2328 was backported to 2.9.x and 3.0.x, this bug wasn't, ie the backport was a much simpler fix (to just address the original memory leak); it's 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and trunk when this bug is present.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"24596","summary":"Lucene is not fsync'ing files on commit","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":8,"total":8,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12521503/comment/13098682","id":"13098682","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"Mike, just to make sure, did you actually see this leads to corruption, or you only suspect it?
