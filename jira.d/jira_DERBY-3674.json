In that class, we checked if we are trying to compress a VTI (which in this jira entry's case is SYSCS_DIAG.TRANSACTION_TABLE) and if yes, then we did nothing and simply returned from the OnlineCompress class. \r\n\r\nWith changes for DERBY-1062, we have moved the code from OnlineCompress into ALTER TABLE related compile and execute classes(namely AlterTableNode and AlterTableConstantAction). In ALTER TABLE, we can tell in the bind phase in AlterTableNode.bindStatement() that we are dealing with VTI but there is no easy way to say we are done since we are dealing with inplace compress of VTI and hence let's quit. I can try to change code in compile and execute time to somehow ignore inplace compress on VTI but I was curious if there is a more graceful way to just quit out of compile phase (and skip execute phase all together) since we know inplace compress on VTI should be treated as no-op.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.
