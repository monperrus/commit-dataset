- it would help if one wanted to run the same spellchecker with different defaults and different query handlers , ie, different defaults for spellchecker if using qt=standard vs qt=dismax. \r\n\r\nIn your implementation, we'd have to have a different spellchecker component handler defined, which is fine in most cases, at least for me...

Yeah, this probably makes sense. We could roll this one back. I haven't tested it, but I'm thinking it is just a documentation issue, then, right? As the ReqHandler will take care of the default handling stuff.\r\n\r\nYes, I think we should do that. No need to rewrite the defaults/appends/invariants parameter handling in this component which is taken care of by request handlers.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shalinmangar","name":"shalinmangar","emailAddress":"shalin dot mangar at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501"},"displayName":"Shalin Shekhar Mangar","active":true},"created":"2008-06-30T17:59:44.218+0000","updated":"2008-06-30T17:59:44.218+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399135/comment/12609314","id":"12609314","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"body":"OK, I committed this, give it a try.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"created":"2008-06-30T18:04:38.595+0000","updated":"2008-06-30T18:04:38.595+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399135/comment/12610634","id":"12610634","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ronbraun","name":"ronbraun","emailAddress":"ronbraun at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ronald Braun","active":true},"body":"Is the accuracy (or sp.query.accuracy) parameter from SpellCheckerRequestHandler also supported by SpellCheckComponent (there is no documentation about it on the wiki)?
