There was already code to do this in NetStatementRequest, but it didn't seem to be used. I activated this code, but since older servers don't expect parameters to be sent as booleans, I also added a new metadata method to check if this is supported by the server. I need to do some more digging to see if the code was actually used in some situations in 10.7 after all, in which case we need more logic to decide whether or not to use the code.\r\n\r\n4) Server: Let DRDAConnThread know what to do if it receives a parameter value with type equal to DRDAConstants.DRDA_TYPE_NBOOLEAN.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2011-01-11T13:46:01.931+0000","updated":"2011-01-11T13:46:01.931+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12495228/comment/12980137","id":"12980137","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Some issues with the 1a patch:\r\n\r\n1) Two failures in NullIfTest (expected:<[1]> but was:<[true]>)\r\n\r\n2) trunk client against 10.7 server gives ClassCastException when calling PreparedStatement.setBoolean()\r\n\r\n3) The patch only partially fixes the problem on the client side.

The table column length must be at\r\n| least 5.\r\n`----\r\n\r\nBefore the change, our drivers behaved like what's described for the\r\nDB2 Universal JDBC Driver. After the change, our drivers behave like\r\nwhat the document describes for the DB2 JDBC Type 2 Driver, with the\r\nexception that the value \"true\" can be inserted into a column whose\r\nlength is 4.\r\n\r\nThe other reference to differences.html in CrossConverters.java is\r\nabout getBoolean() semantics. Here's what the document says about that\r\ncase:\r\n\r\n,----\r\n| Result of using getBoolean to retrieve a value from a CHAR column\r\n| \r\n| With the DB2 Universal JDBC Driver, when you execute\r\n| ResultSet.getBoolean or CallableStatement.getBoolean to retrieve a\r\n| Boolean value from a CHAR column, and the column contains the value\r\n| \"false\" or \"0\", the value false is returned. If the column contains\r\n| any other value, true is returned.\r\n| \r\n| With the DB2 JDBC Type 2 Driver, when you execute ResultSet.getBoolean\r\n| or CallableStatement.getBoolean to retrieve a Boolean value from a\r\n| CHAR column, and the column contains the value \"true\" or \"1\", the\r\n| value true is returned. If the column contains any other value, false\r\n| is returned.\r\n`----\r\n\r\nHere, both our drivers behave like the DB2 Universal JDBC Driver.
