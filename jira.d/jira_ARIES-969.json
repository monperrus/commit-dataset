This can be used to temporarily disable a Blueprint bundle.\"\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is not currently implemented. As well as not being spec-compliant, it can be time consuming to scan large bundles for blueprint files. I'll firstly use this defect to change the behaviour so as to become spec-compliant. \r\n\r\nOne problem with the spec as written is that bundles that do not contain blueprint must \"opt out\" of blueprint management by including an empty Bundle-Blueprint header. This is a problem for users that consume third party bundles that are unwilling or unable to modify their manifests. So I'm going to add a system property, \"org.apache.aries.blueprint.header.mandatory\". Its default value will be \"false\". Setting it to 'true' will mean that bundles that do not contain a Bundle-Blueprint: header in their manifests will not be scanned for blueprint and will not get runtime blueprint containers. ModelledResourceManagerImpl.findBlueprints() is expensive for large bundles, so this will yield substantial performance improvements for such users.
