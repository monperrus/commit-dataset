Schindler","active":true},"body":"Hi Robert, no generics complaints, it cannot be done better (means warning-free, that's a backwards-API-bug in Java - as always. Reflection-APIs and other APIs in general should return collections not raw arrays; the horrible thing here is that reflection have to create a new array on every invocation (clone), as it could be modified later. With Lists it could return unmodifiableList... Oracle should fix this and break backwards, as we should with CR.getSequentialSubReaders as there is not overhead at all).\r\n\r\nI am a little bit irritated about the catch block:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n+            if (e instanceof UnsupportedOperationException) {\r\n+              // ignore\r\n+              System.err.println(\"WARNING: \" + e + \" for \" + clazz);\r\n+            } else if (e instanceof InvocationTargetException) {\r\n+              if (e.getCause() instanceof IllegalArgumentException ||\r\n+                  e.getCause() instanceof UnsupportedOperationException) {\r\n+                // thats ok\r\n+                if (VERBOSE) {\r\n+                  System.err.println(\"Ignoring IAE/UOE from ctor:\");\r\n+                  e.printStackTrace();\r\n+                }\r\n+              } else {\r\n+                // not ok\r\n+                System.err.println(clazz);\r\n+                throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n+              }\r\n+            } else {\r\n+              throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n+            }\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe first check for Unsupported cannot come from the called ctor only from reflection code itsself, but reflection should not throw UOE.\r\n\r\nWhen you call a ctor with reflection, every Throwable the CTOR throws is wrapped by InvocationTargetException. So the code in my opinion should *only* catch InvocationTargetException and then check for the corresponding \"valid\" causes. All other causes (not the ITE) should be rethrown using o.a.l.util.Rethrow (and not wrapped with Runtime). And any other reflection-based Ex should not be catched at all.\r\n\r\nI will play around and remove the big Exception bug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-04-09T08:20:35.063+0000","updated":"2012-04-09T08:20:35.063+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12550182/comment/13249737","id":"13249737","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Patch with the above mentioned cleanups.
