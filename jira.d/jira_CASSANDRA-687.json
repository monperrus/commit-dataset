may not be readable until later), this is a source of much confusion (most people seem to assume that the existing ONE behaves like ANY)\r\n(2) ANY should be added at the end of the enum to avoid breaking older clients unnecessarily\r\n(3) Can we move the hint_ack tracking into the coordinator code instead of modifying RM and RMVH?  We already have endpointMap that tells us which writes are hinted, seems like we shouldn't need the reply to specify that
