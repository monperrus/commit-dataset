The repro script executes a statement, closes the connection then asks the resultset if it is closed. The resultset says it is not, and based on this the repro then executes an operation that causes an exception to be thrown. A correct answer from ResultSet.isClosed() would not have caused an exception in the repro.\r\n\r\nAccording to the JDBC4 spec: \"A ResultSet is closed if the method close has been called on it, or if it is automatically closed.\"\r\nI thought closing the underlying connection should close all associated resources, including the resultset(s). Am I mistaken?\r\n\r\nI notice that ResultSet.isClosed() simply returns a variable ('isClosed'), and to me it seems that the state of this variable is not maintained correctly (have not looked at the code), thus the ResultSet.isClosed() method suffers the same problem as Statement.isClosed(). We must either ensure the internal state is kept correct, or we must add extra checks to the isClosed methods.\r\nAlthough the latter solution is very simple (at least for Statement), I personally think it would be better if the close methods were executed also when the resources are automatically \"closed\".\r\n\r\nDan, since you have assigned yourself to this issue, can you tell me how your (planned) solution would affect the internal state variables in ResultSet and Statment, so that I can fix Statement.isClosed accordingly?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2006-03-13T00:09:28.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-13T00:09:28.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12330137/comment/12370115","id":"12370115","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"body":"Are there bugs open for the incorrect results from Statement.isClosed() and ResultSet.isClosed?

Maybe if it's only at the\r\n     Statement level it's not too bad a concern, but there would have to be some additional logic to handle server-side JDBC. In the server-side case\r\n      I don't think you want to set up the WeakHashMap, if you did the performance overhead would be a concern, because with server-side\r\n       logic there is no way for the application to hang onto statements for multiple applications like a JDBC client program can. Also J2EE\r\n       applications tend to be stateless and therefore incur Statement creation on each execution.\r\n\r\nFor ResultSet.isClosed() a simple way of implementing it would be:\r\n\r\n  if (isClosed)\r\n     return true;\r\n \r\n   try {\r\n         checkExecStatus();\r\n          return false;\r\n} catch (SQLException sqle)\r\n{\r\n     return isClosed;\r\n}\r\n\r\nA similar approach would work for Statement.isClosed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"created":"2006-03-14T13:13:32.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-14T13:13:32.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12330137/comment/12370338","id":"12370338","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"I do not disagree that it is easy to implement isClosed to return the intended results (I commented this when uploading the patch for DERBY-953).\r\n\r\nHowever, by looking briefly at EmbedConnection, I cannot immediatly see how assoicated resources are closed when EmbedConnection.close() is called.
