All the expressions that could be used as qualifiers in a multi-probe scan will be on CNF at this point in the code, and those expressions are the only ones that would benefit from such a transformation, as far as I know, so skipping the transformation in those cases should not hurt performance.\r\n\r\nThe current code, without the the patch, partially checks that the OR chain is on CNF by checking that each left operand is either an equals operator or an IN operator. (This is a stricter condition than CNF, which only requires that the left operand is either an AND node on CNF or some node that is not an OR node.) It does however not check that the right operand satisfies the CNF requirements. Instead, it silently assumes that the right operand is either an OR node or a BooleanConstantNode whose value is false.\r\n\r\nThe patch fixes this logic by verifying that the terminating right operand in the chain indeed is Boolean false. If it is not, the conversion to an IN list is skipped. In the examples above where the incorrect conversion happens, the terminating right operand is a node representing {{(b = 'b')}}. Since the original logic assumed that the chain would be terminated by a dummy {{FALSE}} value, which could safely be dropped, it would ignore the {{(b = 'b')}} part of the expression when it created the IN list. Now it will check explicitly that the terminating node is safe to drop, and only do the rewrite if it is safe.\r\n\r\nThe patch also fixes a small bug in OrNode.verifyChangeToCNF() which prevented it from detecting that the right side of the tree was not well-formed. This code is only invoked in debug builds. The check in OrNode.verifyChangeToCNF() now matches the check in AndNode.verifyChangeToCNF().\r\n\r\nAll regression tests passed with the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot
