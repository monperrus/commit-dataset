The test may be vulnerable to timing problems--it is suspicious that the test cranks up 5 threads.\r\n\r\nThis error may flag a bug in the automatic collection of statistics, however. The test fails because it is expects that statistics were collected automatically and in this case they weren't.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this bug is not a regression: the failure to collect statistics will not cause wrong results and it will not even cause a query to run worse than it did in 10.7.
