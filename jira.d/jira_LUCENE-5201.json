impact on people who were using CompressionMode.FAST_DECOMPRESSION (which seems to be confirmed by the fact that we never saw any test failure related to this until today, only a few minutes after I committed LUCENE-5188).\r\n\r\nI was able to write a test case that reproduces the bug and changed the existing tests so that they don't only test compression with a start offset of
