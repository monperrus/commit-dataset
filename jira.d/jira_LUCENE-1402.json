In my opinion, the way how CheckIndex is implemented, is not the cleanest obect-oriented way.

There is one problem:\r\n\r\nWe have a *static* variable pointing to the output Stream. As this variable is static, it is everywhere the same. If I want to create a web application that checks two indexes and this maybe in parallel (because two users started the check index task), I cannot redirect the output stream to an individual \"console\" (e.g. the servlet output stream).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, to be a handy tool, there should be some minor changes:\r\n - the class should have an public constructor getting the Directory\r\n - a public method to set the output stream for the instance (like IndexWriter does with setInfoStream())\r\n - the check/fix methods as instance methods\r\n\r\nThe main() method (which must stay static, which is clear) and the two static and deprecated methods, should instantiate an CheckIndex instance and call the methods using System.err","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2008-09-23T17:25:14.256+0000","updated":"2008-09-23T17:25:14.256+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404954/comment/12633814","id":"12633814","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"In principle, by making each Checkindex an instance, you would also not need the CheckIndexStatus class, the variables could be members of CheckIndex, the usage would be:\r\n\r\n- instantiate CheckIndex with Directory\r\n- boolean ok=check\r\n- if (!ok) fix()\r\n- close checkindex instance\r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility, the main() and two static methods could do exactly this.
