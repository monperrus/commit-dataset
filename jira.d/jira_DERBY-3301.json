HashMap based on a key, and puts all rows matching this key into the map with that key.\r\nFor the repro this means a HashMap with 3 keys with 3, 2 and 3 rows for the map entries respectively as seen in the debugger.\r\n\r\nIn getNextRow() we pick the first element for a given key from the map, then move on to the next key, even though \r\nthere are unfetched entries left in the map. This is where the code is flawed at the moment.\r\n\r\nFor each invocation of getNextRowCore(), a call is done to reopenCore() as well. This looks suspicious. reopenCore() is a good citizen \r\nand resets any reference variables with a call to resetProbeVariables(). This call resets the indexing we use in getNextRowCore() to \r\nkeep track of the index into the map entries, and force us to move on to the next key in the HashMap instead of the next entry in the HashMap. \r\n\r\nIt's right there in the queryplan as well with \"Number of opens = 3\" for the lower HashScanResultSet :)\r\nThere's the reason for the three, and not seven, rows.\r\n\r\nThe big question right now is who calls, and why is, reopenCore() called twice? \r\n\r\nI probably won't have time to investigate until Monday.

In this case it's only used once - in \r\nNesteLoopJoinStrategy.joinResultSetMethodName(), which again is only used in JoinNode.generate.\r\n\r\nSo why is it setting oneRowRightSide to true?\r\n\r\nThe arguments to the NestedLoopJoinResultSet constructor is pushed to the stack by JoinNode.getJoinArguments(), where one calls JoinNode.oneRowRightSide().\r\noneRowRightSide() simply pushes rightResultSet.isOneRowResultSet() to the stack and continues along merrily (JoinNode.java @ 1691)\r\n\r\nIn the debugger we see that the first hit of a breakpoint in JoinNode.java @1691 is the interesting one.\r\nrightResultSet is a ProjectRestrictNode over a FromBaseTable. That is the select we want to look at.\r\n\r\nProjectRestrictNode.isOneRowResult() simply calls its childResult.isOneRowResult(), so we end up in FromBaseTable.isOneRowResult().\r\n\r\nFromBaseTable.isOneRowResult() start off with this comment and code: \r\n   // EXISTS FBT will only return a single row\r\n   if (existsBaseTable)\r\n   {\r\n       return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nexistsBaseTable is true in the failing query.\r\n\r\nexistsBaseTable is only set in FromBaseTable.setExistsBaseTable(), and this method is only called form FromList.genExistsBaseTables()\r\nwhere it is explicitly set to true.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the assumption made in FromBaseTable.isOneRowResultI() is wrong?\r\nIt's been there ever since derby code was donated.

As an \r\nexample, take a look at the last query on the doc page mentioned above,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n  SELECT t1.* FROM t1, t2\r\n  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM t3 WHERE t1.c1 = t3.c1)\r\n\r\n    gets flattened into\r\n\r\n  SELECT t1.* FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE t1.c1 = t3.c1\r\n\r\nIf changes are made to completely avoid flattening of EXISTS subqueries in \r\nWHERE clauses, then the above query will *not* be flattened into an exists join,\r\neven though it's perfectly valid to perform flattening in that case.  With the approach \r\nthat you've outlined the exists join optimization as a whole will be disabled (I think?).  \r\nI think that has the potential to cause a performance regression for users whose \r\nqueries benefit from the EXISTS join optimization today.\r\n\r\nA similar discussion was held for DERBY-3231 and in that case a decision was \r\nmade to deliberately remove an optimization for the sake of correctness.  But the \r\nuse cases affected by that particular optimization were (most likely) few and far\r\nbetween.  With this issue, though, I think removing EXISTS subquery flattening \r\nacross the board will affect far more users, so I worry about committing such a fix.\r\n\r\nThe patch as posted does not apply to the current trunk, but from what I can tell, if \r\nyou run a query like the one mentioned in the documentation, ex.:\r\n\r\ncreate table t1 (c1 int, c2 int, c3 int);\r\ncreate table t2 (i int, j int);\r\ncreate table t3 (c1 int, vc varchar(10));\r\n\r\ninsert into t1 values (1, -1, 1), (3, -3, 9), (2, -2, 4);\r\ninsert into t2 values (2, 4);\r\ninsert into t3 values (1, 'one'), (3, 'three');\r\n\r\nselect t1.* from t1, t2 where exists (select * from t3 where t1.c1 = t3.c1);\r\n\r\nI think derby-3301-1.diff will cause the SELECT to skip flattening of the EXISTS\r\nsubquery.  Is that correct?\r\n\r\nThe core problem for this issue appears to be the specific case where we have a\r\nsubquery SQ1 that appears in the whereClause of *another* subquery SQ0.  In that\r\ncase disabling the flattening of SQ0 would be appropriate--as the documentation\r\nstates.  But if subquery SQ1 appears in the whereClause of an *OUTER* query--as\r\nshown above--I don't think we should disable flattening altogether.\r\n\r\nIf at all possible, I think it'd be better to fix the flattening condition for the specific\r\nsituation of nested subqueries than to completely disable WHERE clause flattening\r\nfor EXISTS subqueries.\r\n\r\nOr put differently: if the documentation is correct, the _intent_ is to skip flattening of\r\nan EXISTS subquery that has predicates which in turn contain other subqueries.\r\nBut the current code does not correctly implement that intent.  So I think it'd be\r\ngood to figure out _why_ the current code is wrong for the case of nested \r\nsubqueries, and then try to make a change that addresses that specific problem.\r\n\r\nOn a slightly different note, have you had a chance to run the regression suites\r\nwith this change?  I'm curious to know if any of the existing tests actually test\r\nfor EXISTS join flattening--and if so, do those tests still pass with the proposed\r\nchange?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2008-01-22T17:20:55.943+0000","updated":"2008-01-22T17:39:06.490+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385521/comment/12561614","id":"12561614","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thomanie","name":"thomanie","emailAddress":"thomas dot nielsen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Nielsen","active":true},"body":"Attaching updated patch 'derby-3301-2.diff'.\r\n\r\nThe condition for skipping flattening should be even more specific than what is implemented in 'derby-3301-2.diff' as per the discussion, so I'm still not marking this with patch available.

But probably more my fault than anything.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant to say was that I expect any patch which completely disables EXISTS\r\nsubquery flattening to theoretically cause at least one test in the regression suite\r\nto fail.  If that's not true--i.e. if all tests pass with such a patch--then it means that\r\nthere are no existing test cases to verify that EXISTS subquery flattening is actually\r\noccuring, and that would warrant a separate (testing) issue.\r\n\r\nBut for your 3b patch, you are *NOT* disabling EXISTS subquery flattening altogether (as\r\ndiscussed earlier), so it's not surprising that existing tests run without error.  That said,\r\nI do think it would be good to add a new regression test to correspond to the specific\r\npatch that you've posted--ex. a new test case based on the attached repro would be\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIf that's still unclear, then the short version is \"Yes, I think a new test case (or set of\r\ntest cases) should be added for this issue\".

The comments say:\r\n\r\n   /* Values subquery is flattenable if:\r\n    * ...\r\n    *  o It is not a nested WHERE EXISTS subquery in a WHERE EXISTS clause (DERBY-3301)\r\n    */\r\n\r\nIgnoring the conditions which were already there, I read this as:\r\n\r\n  \"A subquery SQ1 is flattenable if it is not a nested WHERE EXISTS subquery in the WHERE\r\n  EXISTS clause of another subquery, SQ2\".\r\n\r\nIs that a correct reading?  If so, I think that if SQ1 *is* a nested WHERE EXISTS subquery in\r\nthe WHERE EXISTS clause of SQ2, then it's technically _SQ2_ that is not flattenable, not SQ1.\r\nThat said, the actual code changes in the new \"hasNestedWhereExistsClause()\" look correct,\r\nso I think this is just a comment issue, not a code one.  Maybe a better condition would be:\r\n\r\n  o Either a) it (the subquery) does not appear within a WHERE clause, or b) it appears within\r\n    a WHERE clause but does not itself contain a WHERE clause with other subqueries in it.\r\n\r\nThis definition is quite a bit more wordy, but it matches the documentation and it also matches\r\nthe code in hasNestedWhereExistsClause a bit more closely--though not exactly.  See #2\r\ncomment below...\r\n\r\n2) The logic that exists in hasNestedWhereExistsClause() does exactly what its name implies,\r\ni.e. it checks specifically for \"nested WHERE EXISTS clauses\".  That in itself is good since it\r\naddresses the issue reported.  But I did notice that the documentation for EXISTS join flattening\r\nsuggests a slightly more general condition:\r\n\r\n http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.3/tuning/ctuntransform25868.html\r\n\r\nNamely, it seems like a more complete approach would be check to see if the subquery's\r\nWHERE clause \"includes _any_ subqueries\"--not just WHERE EXISTS subqueries.  For\r\nexample: if the inner-most WHERE EXISTS query was replaced with a WHERE IN or WHERE\r\nANY clause, would we still get the correct results?\r\n\r\nAs an example, I re-wrote the inner-most WHERE EXISTS subquery from derby-3301.sql to use a\r\nWHERE IN clause that effectively duplicates one of the (already-existing) equality predicate, and\r\nso should in theory return the same results...I think? (I could be wrong here):\r\n\r\nselect unbound_e.empid, unbound_p.projid\r\nfrom departments this,\r\n     employees unbound_e,\r\n     projects unbound_p\r\nwhere exists (\r\n    select 1 from employees this_employees_e\r\n    where this_employees_e.empid in (                           -- *** Army changed this\r\n        select this_employees_e_projects_p.empid        -- *** Army changed this\r\n        from project_employees this_employees_e_projects_p\r\n        where this_employees_e_projects_p.empid = this_employees_e.empid\r\n        and this_employees_e.department = this.id\r\n        and unbound_p.projid = this_employees_e_projects_p.projid\r\n        and unbound_e.empid = this_employees_e.empid)\r\n\r\nThis returns three rows:\r\n\r\nEMPID      |PROJID\r\n-----------------------\r\n13         |101\r\n13         |102\r\n15         |103\r\n\r\nIs that correct?  Or should that query be returning 7 rows, as well?  What about if\r\nthe first WHERE EXISTS query is changed to a \"WHERE IN\" query, as well--will\r\nthat behave correctly?\r\n\r\nIf it should return seven rows, as well, then perhaps the new method in SubqueryNode\r\ncould be expanded to check for the existence of _any_ subquery, not just a WHERE\r\nEXISTS subquery?\r\n\r\nOne way to do that might be to use a CollectNodesVisitor to collect all instances of\r\nSubqueryNode.class that appear in \"sn.originalWhereSubquerys\" and/or in\r\n\"sn.originalWhereClause()\"--and if that visitor returns any matches, then the method\r\nreturns \"false\".  I'm not entirely sure that will work, but it seems like it could...?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2008-01-24T18:58:58.310+0000","updated":"2008-01-24T18:58:58.310+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385521/comment/12562427","id":"12562427","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thomanie","name":"thomanie","emailAddress":"thomas dot nielsen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Nielsen","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the input Army.\r\n\r\nAd 1)\r\nI agree, the 3b comments miss the point slightly, and may be seen as 'inverted'.\r\n>\r\n> I think that if SQ1 *is* a nested WHERE EXISTS subquery in the WHERE EXISTS clause of SQ2, then it's technically _SQ2_ that is not flattenable, not SQ1.\r\n>\r\nThis is correct, to my understanding.

But that's just a\r\nnit--it shouldn't block commit of the patch.\r\n\r\nMy only remaining minor comment is that I think it would be good to add test cases for\r\nthe various IN, ANY, and EXISTS combinations that are not currently tested.  As an example,\r\nthe query I posted previously that replaces _both_ instances of \"EXISTS\" with \"IN\" would be a\r\ngood test case to add.  I see that you added a new test case for \"EXISTS ... IN\", which was\r\ngreat--thanks for doing that.  I think a minimal list of combinations to check should be:\r\n\r\n  * WHERE EXISTS ... WHERE EXISTS (done with test-1.diff -- thanks!)\r\n  * WHERE EXISTS ... WHERE IN (done with test-2.diff -- thanks!)\r\n  * WHERE EXISTS .. WHERE ANY\r\n  * WHERE IN ... WHERE IN (I posted an example in my previous post, but it's not included in the tests)\r\n  * WHERE ANY ... WHERE ANY\r\n\r\nBut again, the additional test cases could come as a separate patch later, or perhaps even\r\nas a patch for DERBY-3349.  I.e.

I was operating on the assumption that derbyall ran cleanly with\r\nthe 4c patch; I hadn't run it myself.\r\n\r\n> From a quick look at the diff it seems like the test dumps a query plan that is different\r\n> with the patch\r\n\r\nI confirmed that there is one query for which the query plan is different--and for that specific query,\r\nI think the difference is correct.  Namely, the query has nested WHERE EXISTS subqueries and so,\r\naccording to the findings for this issue, cannot be safely flattened.  So that part seems okay.\r\n\r\nI then noticed that another query further down in the test _also_ has nested WHERE EXISTS\r\nsubqueries, but that query _is_ in fact flattened into an exists join--which runs counter to the\r\nfindings so far for this issue (i.e. it shouldn't be flattened into an EXISTS due to the nested\r\nEXISTS subqueries).  The fact that the query in subqueryFlattening still returns correct rows\r\nsuggests that maybe there are cases where flattening of EXISTS subqueries is \"safe\"--but\r\nthat seems beyond the scope of this issue.\r\n\r\nI played around with the repro for this issue and was able to write the following query:\r\n\r\nselect unbound_e.empid, unbound_p.projid\r\nfrom departments this,\r\n     employees unbound_e,\r\n     projects unbound_p\r\nwhere exists (\r\n    select 1 from employees this_employees_e\r\n    where 1 = 1 and exists (\r\n        select 1 from project_employees this_employees_e_projects_p\r\n        where this_employees_e_projects_p.empid = this_employees_e.empid\r\n        and this_employees_e.department = this.id\r\n        and unbound_p.projid = this_employees_e_projects_p.projid\r\n        and unbound_e.empid = this_employees_e.empid)\r\n    );\r\n\r\nThe only difference between this query and the one in derby-3301.sql is that I've\r\nadded a (no-op) predicate \"1 = 1\" alongside the inner-most EXISTS clause.\r\nSince this creates an AndNode whose left operand is a relational op (\"1 = 1\") and\r\nwhose right operand is a SubqueryNode, the code in the 4c patch that checks\r\nspecifically for a SubqueryNode will not detect it:\r\n\r\n+               if (sn.originalWhereClause != null &&\r\n+                   sn.originalWhereClause instanceof SubqueryNode)  {\r\n+                       ...\r\n\r\nSince whereClause here is actually an AndNode, not a SubqueryNode, the \"if\" statement\r\nabove is not triggered, thus the query is incorrectly flattened into an EXISTS joins.  The\r\nend result is that the query only returns 5 rows when it should return 7 (the extra \"1 = 1\"\r\npredicate shouldn't affect the results).\r\n\r\nI think I mentioned a few comments ago that it might be possible to use a CollectNodesVisitor\r\nto search the whereClause for any SubqueryNodes.  The above example demonstrates why\r\nsuch a visitor would be helpful, as opposed to just checking directly for a SubqueryNode...\r\n\r\nSo to answer Dyre's question, yes, I think a master update will be needed.  But further\r\ninspection of subqueryFlattening.sql shows that the 4c patch may need a few more\r\ntweaks, after all...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2008-01-29T17:26:30.524+0000","updated":"2008-01-29T17:26:30.524+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385521/comment/12563660","id":"12563660","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clr","name":"clr","emailAddress":"craig dot russell at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig L Russell","active":true},"body":"Here are more queries, just slightly modified from the original queries.

In your v5 patch you iterate through each of\r\nthe SubqueryNode's that are found by CollectNodesVisitor and check to see if any of them was\r\nmarked as a \"whereSubquery()\". For some reason that check fails in the query that I posted--i.e.\r\nthe one where I include the \"1 = 1\" predicate. While I don't know why the call to whereSubquery()\r\nreturns false, I also don't think that it's necessary at this particular point.\r\n\r\nThe code that calls CollectNodesVisitor is this line:\r\n\r\n          sn.originalWhereClause.accept(cnv);\r\n\r\nSince we're visiting the original WHERE clause, any SubqueryNodes that we find are necessarily\r\ngoing to be \"WHERE subqueries\" because we found them in a WHERE clause. So it seems like\r\nwe shouldn't have to call \"isWhereSubquery()\" on any of them--we just need to check to see if the\r\nCollectNodesVisitor found at least one, and if so, we're done. I changed your version 5 patch to\r\nlook like this:\r\n\r\n  ....\r\n                if (sn.originalWhereClause != null)\r\n                {\r\n                    /* Second instance of SubqueryNode.class effectively means \"don't bother\r\n                     * searching beneath SubqueryNodes since if we found one, we're done.\"\r\n                     */\r\n                    CollectNodesVisitor cnv =\r\n                        new CollectNodesVisitor(\r\n                            SubqueryNode.class, SubqueryNode.class);\r\n\r\n                    sn.originalWhereClause.accept(cnv);\r\n                    return cnv.getList().isEmpty();\r\n                }\r\n  ....\r\n               \r\nand with that change (everything else the same), the query with \"1 = 1\" returns 7 rows, as it should. The\r\nother queries mentioned by Craig also return the correct results (assuming the first one is supposed to\r\nreturn 2 rows, which I assume it is...?)\r\n\r\nSo it looks like the use of CollectNodesVisitor does help. As for the issue of why the SubqueryNode's\r\nfound in originalWhereClause return false for \"isWhereSubquery()\", I haven't looked at that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2008-01-30T23:42:49.801+0000","updated":"2008-01-30T23:42:49.801+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385521/comment/12564225","id":"12564225","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"body":"On a complete unrelated note, I think the preference for Derby codeline is to keep lines\r\nshorter than 80 characters (where possible).

In tracing it turns out that, for those cases,\r\nthe CollectNodesVisitor does not find the SubqueryNodes in \"sn.originalWhereClause\".\r\nI think it comes down to something you mentioned earlier, namely:\r\n\r\n> I still need to have another look at [the \"1 = 1\"] variant, as it doesn't seem\r\n> to end up with a similar querytree to the others\r\n\r\nUpon further inspection, I think you are right about this.\r\n\r\nFor reference, this is the query in question.  Note the tags on the right for\r\nthe sake of discussion, where \"SN\" implies \"SelectNode\":\r\n\r\nselect unbound_e.empid, unbound_p.projid                             -- SN_OUTER\r\nfrom departments this,\r\n     employees unbound_e,\r\n     projects unbound_p\r\nwhere exists (\r\n    select 1 from employees this_employees_e                         -- SN_INNER_1\r\n    where 1 = 1 and exists (\r\n        select 1 from project_employees this_employees_e_projects_p  -- SN_INNER_2\r\n        where this_employees_e_projects_p.empid = this_employees_e.empid\r\n        and this_employees_e.department = this.id\r\n        and unbound_p.projid = this_employees_e_projects_p.projid\r\n        and unbound_e.empid = this_employees_e.empid)\r\n    );\r\n\r\nBy the time we reach SubqueryNode.isWhereExistsAnyInWithWhereSubquery() for the\r\nSubqueryNode wrapping SN_INNER_1, the clause:\r\n\r\n  where 1 = 1 and exists ( ... )\r\n\r\nends up as an AndNode whose left operand is \"1 = 1\" but whose right operand is the\r\nconstant literal TRUE--which is not what we expect.  We expect the AndNode's right\r\noperand to be the SubqueryNode corresponding to SN_INNER_2.  That is, if \"sn\" is the\r\nSelectNode for SN_INNER_1 then sn.originalWhereClause should include the SubqueryNode\r\nthat wraps SN_INNER_2.  That is true when we first set sn.originalWhereClause in the\r\ninit() method of SelectNode--but by the time we get to preprocessing for the SubqueryNode\r\nwrapping SN_INNER_1, the SubqueryNode for SN_INNER_2 is no longer in SN_INNER_1's\r\noriginalWhereClause.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, this is because sn.originalWhereClause for SN_INNER_1 points to\r\nthe same object as sn.whereClause.  So when sn.whereClause is itself transformed due to\r\nflattening of the subquery SN_INNER_2 (which is legal), sn.originalWhereClause() sees\r\nthe same transformation.  Thus the SubqueryNode wrapping SN_INNER_2 disappears from\r\nsn.whereClause, which is good--but it also disappears from sn.originalWhereClause(),\r\nwhich is bad.  The fact that it disappears means that CollectNodesVisitor for SN_INNER_1\r\nwill not find it, and thus SN_INNER_1 will be flattened, which is not legal.\r\n\r\nWith the negation operator gone (as in patch 6), the fact that we can't find the SubqueryNode\r\nfor SN_INNER_2 causes the method to incorrectly return \"true\" (because CNV's list is empty),\r\nwhich is then negated by the caller and thus flattening of SN_INNER_1 is accidentally (but\r\ncorrectly) avoided.  I think it's clear that the negation operator should be there, though.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best way to address that would be--but before you go there,\r\ncan you double-check these findings to see if you agree?  Maybe I'm just missing\r\nsomething obvious...\r\n\r\nApologies for the negation slip-up to begin with.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2008-01-31T18:14:03.043+0000","updated":"2008-01-31T18:14:03.043+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385521/comment/12564465","id":"12564465","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thomanie","name":"thomanie","emailAddress":"thomas dot nielsen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Nielsen","active":true},"body":"Another excellent catch Army!
