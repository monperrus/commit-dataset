As stated in the sources of G1, for example:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n// 4) Now, there is a very subtle issue with all the above. The\r\n// framework will call get_memory_usage() on the three pools\r\n// asynchronously.

Thread[ReaderThread,5,main]\r\n2.  Thread[main,5,main]\r\n3.  Thread[Reference Handler,10,system]\r\n4.  Thread[Signal Dispatcher,9,system]\r\n5.  Thread[Finalizer,8,system]\r\n6.  Thread[Attach Listener,5,system]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAnd with IBM JDK:\r\n{noformat}\r\n1.  Thread[Attach API wait loop,10,main]\r\n2.  Thread[Finalizer thread,5,system]\r\n3.  Thread[JIT Compilation Thread,10,system]\r\n4.  Thread[main,5,main]\r\n5.  Thread[Gc Slave Thread,5,system]\r\n6.  Thread[ReaderThread,5,main]\r\n7.  Thread[Signal Dispatcher,5,main]\r\n8.  Thread[MemoryPoolMXBean notification dispatcher,6,main]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe 8th thread is the one that started only after accessing the memory management layer. The thing is, that in the IBM JDK that thread is created in the ThreadGroup \"main\", while in the Oracle JDK it is created under \"system\". To me the latter makes more sense. \r\n\r\nTo be more sure I added a fake memory notification listener and check the thread in which notification happens: \r\n{code}\r\nMemoryMXBean mmxb = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();\r\nNotificationListener listener = new NotificationListener() {\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback) {\r\n    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n((NotificationEmitter) mmxb).addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nEvidently in IBM JDK the notification is in \"main\" group thread (also in line with the thread-group in the original warning message which triggered this threads discussion):\r\n{noformat}\r\nThread[MemoryPoolMXBean notification dispatcher,6,main]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nWhile in Oracle JDK notification is in \"system\" group thread:\r\n{noformat}\r\nThread[Low Memory Detector,9,system]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis also explains why the warning is reported only for IBM JDK: because the threads check in LTC only account for the threads in the same thread-group as the one running the specific test case. So when dispatching happens in a \"system\" group thread it is not sensed by that check at all.\r\n\r\nOk now with mystery solved I can commit the simpler code...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"created":"2012-02-06T06:33:17.716+0000","updated":"2012-02-06T06:33:17.716+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12540949/comment/13202121","id":"13202121","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"body":"Committed:\r\n- r1241355 - trunk\r\n- r1241363 - 3x","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"created":"2012-02-07T07:05:13.531+0000","updated":"2012-02-07T07:05:13.531+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-3746/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04ijz:"}}
