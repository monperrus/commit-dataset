Ie, even docIDs all\r\nget one score and odd docIDs all get another score.\r\n\r\nOnce I added the hard tie-breaker (ord) the scores are the same.\r\n\r\nHowever... there's a separate bug, that can over-count the tf, such\r\nthat if I create the MPQ like this:\r\n{noformat}\r\n  mpq.add(new Term[] {new Term(\"field\", \"a\")}, 0);\r\n  mpq.add(new Term[] {new Term(\"field\", \"b\"), new Term(\"field\", \"c\")}, 0);\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nI get tf=2 per doc, but if I create it like this:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n  mpq.add(new Term[] {new Term(\"field\", \"b\"), new Term(\"field\", \"c\")}, 0);\r\n  mpq.add(new Term[] {new Term(\"field\", \"a\")}, 0);\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nI get tf=1 (which I think is correct?).\r\n\r\nThis happens because MultipleTermPositions freely returns the same\r\nposition more than once: it just unions the positions of the two\r\nstreams, so when both have their term at pos=0, you'll get pos=0\r\ntwice, which is not good and leads to over-counting tf.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't see a performant way to fix that... and I'm not\r\nsure that it really matters that much in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"24981","summary":"MultiPhraseQuery
