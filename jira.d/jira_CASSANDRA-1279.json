Requests came in the order of K1(1 thru 10), K2(11 thru 12), K3(13 thru15) and the test checked if K2 and K3 requests ran earlier then their request order. With the scheduler starting simultaneously, the requests were pretty much routed in order +/- the jvm thread scheduling order, hence the cause for the bug. \r\n\r\nNow the scheduler is paused still all the requests arrive and placed in their respective queues. When the scheduler is resumed, each pass retrieves one request from each keyspace queue, hence since K2 & K3 have only 2 and 3 requests, they get serviced faster than the order in which they arrived. This test just validates that the requests are RoundRobin and that's what we want to unit test.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rnirmal","name":"rnirmal","emailAddress":"rnirmal at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nirmal Ranganathan","active":true},"created":"2010-07-20T21:51:19.729+0000","updated":"2010-07-20T21:52:20.533+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12469264/comment/12890481","id":"12890481","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"committed","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-07-20T22:03:44.615+0000","updated":"2010-07-20T22:03:44.615+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12469264/comment/12890711","id":"12890711","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","emailAddress":"jira at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true},"body":"Integrated in Cassandra #496 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Cassandra/496/])\r\n    fix RoundRobinSchedulerTest heisenbug.  patch by Nirmal Ranganathan;
