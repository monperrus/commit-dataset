DERBY-491 and DERBY-492 are completely different problems and I'll have more to say about them later.)\r\n\r\nThe basis of the DERBY-170 problem is the method DDMReader.skipDss; this method does not properly handle large DDM Objects which are written using continued DSS data structures.\r\n\r\nThe way that the bug gets to this point is as follows:\r\n1) The client sends a PRPSQLSTT to prepare the insert statement\r\n2) The prepare fails because the table doesn't exist; the server correctly sends back an error message.\r\n3) The client has already moved on to sending the DSCSQLSTT request. The server reads this, notices that the prepare failed, and skips through the request.\r\n4) The client has already moved on to sending the EXCSQLSTT request. The server reads this, notices that the prepare failed, and calls skipRemainder to skip through the request.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem occurs. The client has included the enormous character string as the parameter to the EXCSQLSTT; this parameter string is so long that it is continued through multiple 32K blocks. However, the skipRemainder method can't handle continued objects properly. What it does is to read the first block, note that it is a continued object, and then calls skipDSS to skip it. But skipDSS only skips the first 32K segment of the giant parameter; it doesn't skip the continued object segments. So the skipRemainder() method terminates without having digested the entire parameter object, and control pops out to the main processCommands loop, which then reads the  next parameter object segment, tries to interpret it as a new DSS, and rejects it with an assert.\r\n\r\nHere is the diff that I am currently experimenting with; so far, results have been promising. Please let me know your opinions on my analysis of the problem so far.\r\n\r\nIndex: DDMReader.java^M\r\n===================================================================^M\r\n--- DDMReader.java  (revision 357039)^M\r\n+++ DDMReader.java  (working copy)^M\r\n@@ -1348,6 +1348,11 @@^M\r\n     */\r\n    protected void skipDss() throws DRDAProtocolException\r\n    {\r\n+       while (dssIsContinued)\r\n+       {\r\n+           skipBytes((int)dssLength);\r\n+           readDSSContinuationHeader();\r\n+       }\r\n        skipBytes((int)dssLength);\r\n        topDdmCollectionStack = EMPTY_STACK;\r\n        ddmScalarLen = 0;\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2005-12-16T02:59:10.000+0000","updated":"2005-12-16T02:59:10.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/30720/comment/12362554","id":"12362554","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Attached is a proposed patch for DERBY-170, which teaches the skipDSS method how to handle segmented DDM objects.

The issue in DDMReader.java on the server side is that its implementation of ensureBLayerDataInBuffer, in the \"is continued\" case, was not calling ensureALayerDataInBuffer. The implementation on the client side is slightly different, and it always calls ensureALayerDataInBuffer, in both the \"is continued\" case and in the non-continued case. So I believe that the client code is correct with respect to this problem.\r\n\r\nWhile stepping through the Reply.java code, I did see a few things that worried me:\r\n - the comment which accompanies Reply.compressBLayerData seems almost totally wrong to me and I fear it could substantially mislead future readers of the code\r\n - the implementation of Reply.compressBLayerData uses an inline for() loop to shift the bytes around, rather than calling System.arraycopy, which seems like it could be a performance problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, neither of these seemed serious enough to warrant including into this particular patch.\r\n\r\nCan you take another look at the client's Reply.java and let me know if you think I've misunderstood it?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-01-15T01:48:23.000+0000","updated":"2006-01-15T01:48:23.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/30720/comment/12362747","id":"12362747","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"I updated my sandbox and attached a new diff against the latest trunk.
