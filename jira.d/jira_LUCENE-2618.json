When you call maybeMerge lucene does not guarantee the final result.

We should fix the code to throw the exception immediately.

We can't just look at the version of the segments_N file, for example, because one segment could be from 2.9, and [say] 3.1 had last opened the index and written the 3.x file format for segments_N.  See, IW does not go and open all SegmentReaders on open.  It's only on merge, applying deletes, or opening an NRT reader, that we go and open segments for reading.\r\n\r\nI think to do this correctly we should modify segments_N format to record the oldest segment in the index?  Then IW can check this easily on open.\r\n\r\nbq. I don't mind if you continue w/ the fix to the test as you did, but IMO it just hides the real problem.
