with the default transport, I believe we should change it to being framed, for compatibility with non-blocking clients (this actually came up during an attempt to use a Twisted client).\r\n\r\nThis

Whether or not the transport is framed or not is an implementation detail of Thrift, it sucks that we would be forced to expose this to our users.\r\n\r\n2. Until THRIFT-210 is complete (better yet, THRIFT-538), there won't be any one setting that will let you run a server compatible with all clients. For example, with a framed transport enabled C# clients currently aren't possible, conversely without a framed transport, Twisted clients are left out in the cold.\r\n \r\nIt has been my hope that the Thrift team would close at least THRIFT-210 (there is a patch attached), so that we could accommodate all of our users with a framed transport (and without requiring it to be configured).\r\n\r\nHowever, considering how long THRIFT-210 has been open (and considering the complete lack of response to THRIFT-538), it may in fact be necessary to add an option so that our users can at least choose what (not  )to support.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=urandom","name":"urandom","emailAddress":"eevans at opennms dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031"},"displayName":"Eric Evans","active":true},"created":"2009-07-21T23:16:44.675+0000","updated":"2009-07-21T23:16:44.675+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12428401/comment/12740827","id":"12740827","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"Should we move this to 0.5?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-08-08T03:13:02.941+0000","updated":"2009-08-08T03:13:02.941+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12428401/comment/12740840","id":"12740840","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=euphoria","name":"euphoria","emailAddress":"michael dot greene at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Greene","active":true},"body":"It shouldn't be too difficult to make framed an option.
