The cause is that two session\r\nstates introduced (SECACC and CHKSEC) is missing in the switch in\r\nDRDAConnThread.run().\r\n\r\nSome comments: \r\n\r\n1) Testing of maxThreads/timeSlice is obviously non-existing since a\r\n   regression can live for nearly two years. I'll file an issue on\r\n   this.\r\n\r\n2) When timeSlice is defined, a timeout of the same size is set on the\r\n   socket. It has been like this since the dawn of times (which in\r\n   this case happens to be 2004-08-26 16:13:46), but Kathey added a\r\n   comment that the timeout is \"highly suspect\", and I agree. Since\r\n   SocketTimeoutException (introduced in J2SE 1.4) is not handled, the\r\n   socket will be closed down when the timeout expires. This may be ok\r\n   for applications using a connection pool which sanitychecks\r\n   connections before reusing them, but disastrous for other\r\n   applications. Without the timeout, a DRDAConnThread waiting for\r\n   input, will not yield until another request comes from the\r\n   client.\r\n\r\n3) I experimented with catching the timeout in the DRDAConnThread as\r\n   the only other change, and that seems to work. If the timeslice is\r\n   setvery low (less than 100ms) I get problems which I guess stems\r\n   from missing corner cases which may well appear with higher\r\n   timeslices e.g. if the load is high or the query tekes a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess the best approach is to let the timeout be as it is for the\r\nmoment and file a separate issue for proper handling of the\r\ntimeout. \r\n\r\nAny comments?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bernt","name":"bernt","emailAddress":"bernt at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernt M.
