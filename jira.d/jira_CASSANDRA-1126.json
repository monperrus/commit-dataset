From an automation perspective then, I have to drop the tar.gz, expand, then process cassandra.yaml. Not a big deal, but I'd rather have the ability to keep the parts that are host-specific outside the classpath and the static tar.gz that lays everything down when provisioning out a new host. It's easier to upgrade that way, easier to use an IDS, easier to backup, etc.\r\n\r\nAs another example, we run an embedded server in our functional tests with temporary data and commit dirs created at runtime. Because the config has to be on the classpath, I have to get a cassandra.yaml config on the test classpath, load and process it before starting the embedded server. I'd rather just write out my new config file to the same temporary directory as my logs and datafiles and point the embedded server at that.\r\n\r\nAgain, not a big deal at all but it's already made my automation noticeably easier.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eonnen","name":"eonnen","emailAddress":"eonnen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erik Onnen","active":true},"created":"2010-05-25T02:15:30.441+0000","updated":"2010-05-25T02:15:30.441+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12465316/comment/12870956","id":"12870956","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"I'd be fine with a -Dcassandra.yaml=X that gives a different filename, to load from the classpath.

So, the first patch is the right one :-). The one I uploaded actually cannot be the implementation for the requirements. Since it still load the file from class path.\r\n\r\nI'm uploading patch as you suggested for this JIRA because I found it's scheduled for 0.7.0 andI believe that there are needs to using different file name other than (cassandra.yaml) and/ or different location. It will give big flexibility for automate starting process (as stated by Erik). From this point of view, both first one and second one can work.\r\n\r\nFor using variable in .sh script, is the value of the CASSANDRA_CONF is a absolute path? if it is, i believe it's similar with first approach, if it's file name only, it's similar to the second approach.
