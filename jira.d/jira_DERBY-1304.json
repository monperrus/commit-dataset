So there is no actual binding done in DROP VIEW at all!  It should have created a dependency on the statement, so when its associated descriptor gets dropped, the statement can be invalidated accordingly.  This explains why the second DROP VIEW fails since it is not invalidated by the system.  \r\n\r\nAnother problem I see is if one just prepare the DROP VIEW statement, it will succeed even if the view does not exist.  This exhibits a different behavior than of DROP TABLE.  I really think this should stay consistent by throwing error at bind time.  However, doing so will definitely trigger a lot of diffs to the existing master output files.  Perhaps this behavior can be corrected in another jira.  Hence in the patch, it only addresses the dependency problem and let execution handle the view existence checking like before.  derbyall passes with this patch.

That makes sense to me. I did not\r\nknow about this behavior of IJ before, so I am glad to learn about it.\r\n\r\nWith your latest patch, things are just as I expected: without the code change,\r\nthe test fails in the expected way, and with the code change the test passes.\r\n\r\nDo you feel like this change is now ready for commit? Unless anybody else\r\nis intending to review it, I can commit it tonight.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-09-19T22:13:59.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-19T22:13:59.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12333366/comment/12436049","id":"12436049","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"body":"I think it is ready for commit.
