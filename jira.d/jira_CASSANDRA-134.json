would take the approach of recording flush time in CFS and then every so often (more frequently than FlushPeriod) scan all CFS and schedule a flush only for those who have not had one already during the last FlushPeriod minutes.\r\n\r\nI could also go for the PeriodicFlushManager approach (always flush every FlushPeriod even if it was recently flushed) if FlushPeriod were per-CF.\r\n\r\nEither
