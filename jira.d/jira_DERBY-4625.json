(If we fix DERBY-4626 that code will probably go away, though.) \r\n\r\nWithout changing 1000 to 1 we can't get the expected result. I am wondering whether there are test cases which is addressed this setValue(..) function. If so since I did not find any regression failures regarding that, can't we conclude that the calculations of SQLChar are still correct?\r\n\r\nThanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nirmal","name":"nirmal","emailAddress":"nirmal070125 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689"},"displayName":"Nirmal Fernando","active":true},"created":"2010-09-01T19:14:33.407+0000","updated":"2010-09-01T19:14:33.407+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12462637/comment/12905365","id":"12905365","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nirmal","name":"nirmal","emailAddress":"nirmal070125 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689"},"displayName":"Nirmal Fernando","active":true},"body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI have attached a patch to DERBY-4614 which is intended to address this issue as well.\r\nSince both issues are co-related to some extent, it's difficult to provide a separate patch.\r\n\r\nThanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nirmal","name":"nirmal","emailAddress":"nirmal070125 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689"},"displayName":"Nirmal Fernando","active":true},"created":"2010-09-02T01:10:34.903+0000","updated":"2010-09-02T01:10:34.903+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12462637/comment/12905434","id":"12905434","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"> I am wondering whether there are test cases which is addressed this\r\n> setValue(..) function.

So that's actually a good thing! :)\r\n\r\nHowever, the change also makes the code in SQLChar a bit\r\nconfusing.

Also, since the above\r\ncode now transforms nanoseconds to nanoseconds (that is, it doesn't do\r\nanything), we should probably simplify it to:\r\n\r\n    int nanos = theValue.getNanos();","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-09-02T07:13:28.112+0000","updated":"2010-09-02T07:13:28.112+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12462637/comment/12910549","id":"12910549","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nirmal","name":"nirmal","emailAddress":"nirmal070125 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689"},"displayName":"Nirmal Fernando","active":true},"body":"Patch #2 is addressing Knut's latest comment!\r\nHope this issue is solved now!\r\n\r\nThanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nirmal","name":"nirmal","emailAddress":"nirmal070125 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689"},"displayName":"Nirmal Fernando","active":true},"created":"2010-09-17T12:11:07.920+0000","updated":"2010-09-17T12:11:07.920+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12462637/comment/12913005","id":"12913005","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Thanks, Nirmal!\r\n\r\nThe patch looks good to me.
