The Reference Manual does bother to document SPACE_TABLE in greater detail, telling the user what the returned columns mean. Instead of adding these diagnostic vtis to the public api, it might make more sense to beef up the descriptions in the \"SYSCS_DIAG diagnostic tables and functions\" section of the Reference  Manual.\r\n\r\nBeefing up the description of LOCK_TABLE would just involve copying the header information from LockTable into the Reference Manual. The other, under-documented vtis could be handled similarly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2013-02-06T14:03:34.137+0000","updated":"2013-02-06T14:03:34.137+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12630579/comment/13572442","id":"13572442","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chaase3","name":"chaase3","emailAddress":"camilla dot haase at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kim Haase","active":true},"body":"That sounds like a great idea, Rick.
