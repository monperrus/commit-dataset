to DataSource\r\n - replaced commons io call to delete directory\r\n - added an extra sanity check\r\n - added test as testRepeatedDatabaseCreationWithAutoStats in memory.MemoryLeakFixesTest. Should be run with 'ant junit-lowmem' (after building Derby), which uses a 16 MB heap.\r\n\r\nThe test failed when run without the fix, it succeeded with patch 1a applied.\r\nPatch ready for review.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2011-08-10T09:28:15.511+0000","updated":"2011-08-10T09:28:15.511+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514127/comment/13089364","id":"13089364","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Committed patches 1a and 2a to trunk with revision 1160593.\r\nBackported to 10.8 with revision 1160595.\r\n\r\nI don't expect more work on this issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2011-08-23T09:23:49.486+0000","updated":"2011-08-23T09:23:49.486+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514127/comment/13108871","id":"13108871","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"The test  testRepeadedDatabaseCreationWithAutoStats has a lot of verbosity with -Dderby.test.trace=true\r\n\r\ntestRepeatedDatabaseCreationWithAutoStats -- 0\r\n-- 1\r\n-- 2\r\n-- 3\r\n-- 4\r\n-- 5\r\n-- 6\r\n-- 7\r\n-- 8\r\n-- 9\r\n-- 10\r\n-- 11\r\n-- 12\r\n-- 13\r\n\r\nShould this traceit call be prntln  so it just prnts with -Dderby.tests.debug=true ?\r\n       while (iter < 50) {\r\n            \r\n            traceit(\"-- \" + iter++);\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2011-09-20T18:05:06.142+0000","updated":"2011-09-20T18:05:06.142+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514127/comment/13109511","id":"13109511","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Yes.
