Just to be sure I was remembering this correctly, I just now tested it.  It provides 80+% improvement over BRAF, even more on a heavily loaded system.  This was clearly a failure on my part to document it at as such.  The header is so small (56 bytes I think) the OS will cache it just fine and not using buffered output will avoid both the memcopies and GC from the buffers.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\ntodo: still needs to delete the .headers after a successful replay as well as the .log.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nthank you, I hadn't realized there were two places the logs were getting removed.  Done.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nI'd rather fix BRAF to generate correct EOFExceptions in case other code runs into this. (And by removing the EOFException check, we introduce a new bug that if the size int is incomplete, we die again.)\r\n\r\n(actually BRAF.read should be returning -1, so that RAF.readFully throws EOFException) \r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIt was not at EOF, the buffer the data was supposed to be written into was zero length.  There was data in the file, but no where to write it in the buffer (because the size read was 0, new byte[size] resulted in a zero length array was was then supposed to be filled by BRAF.readFully).\r\n\r\nI've added tests to catch this problem (as well as other related ones) and also changed BRAF to throw a more reasonable exception (but not EOF).  I believe BRAF.readFully will already throw EOF if it is at the end of the file.\r\n\r\nThe size of the log entry is now CRCed on it's own.  Whlie testing with random garbage at the end of a commit log, I had written a really large int to the size field which resulted in recover() trying to allocate a massive byte[] and getting OOM.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nby removing the EOFException check, we introduce a new bug that if the size int is incomplete, we die again.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\ngood catch.  I have no idea WTF I was thinking, there was even a comment that warned about it that got removed when the try/catch was removed.  I was probably trying to test something and removed it so it'd spew but forgot to put it back.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mdennis","name":"mdennis","emailAddress":"mdennis at riptano dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matthew F.
