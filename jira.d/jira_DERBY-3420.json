By proposing to\r\nremove the implementation, I was agreeing with John's observation that if\r\nwe don't wish to document and test the feature, why do we want to keep the code?\r\nWe could always recover the code later from the svn history if we changed our mind.\r\n\r\nI think at this point I find that I don't understand what purpose the feature has, but\r\non the other hand am quite happy to leave the feature if the community feels it\r\nmight be useful.\r\n\r\nBut if we decide to leave it, it seems like we ought to be able to come up with\r\nenough of an example of how to use it, that we could turn that example into\r\na test and some documentation.\r\n\r\nKim, when you originally reported this issue, you wrote that the -ca option\r\nwas \"no longer needed and is deprecated\"; do you recall what discussions led\r\nto that conclusion?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2009-01-20T14:46:04.462+0000","updated":"2009-01-20T14:46:04.462+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12388689/comment/12665441","id":"12665441","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Here's an example of how to use it:\r\n\r\n1) Create a file called connection.properties which contains:\r\n\r\nterritory=no_NO\r\ncollation=TERRITORY_BASED\r\ncreate=true\r\n\r\n2) Start ij with -ca connection.properties\r\n\r\nNow databases that don't exist should be automatically created when you connect to them, and they should have Norwegian collation by default.\r\n\r\n3) Connect to a database that doesn't already exist and see that it's created and that ORDER BY uses Norwegian collation rules:\r\n\r\nij> connect 'jdbc:derby:mydb';\r\nij> select * from (values 'aa','ab','ba','bb') v(x) order by x;\r\nX \r\n--\r\nab\r\nba\r\nbb\r\naa\r\n\r\n4 rows selected","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2009-01-20T15:32:16.691+0000","updated":"2009-01-20T15:32:16.691+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12388689/comment/12665478","id":"12665478","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"DERBY-3105 contains the discussion which led to the\r\nconclusion that the -ca argument should be removed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2009-01-20T17:21:40.640+0000","updated":"2009-01-20T17:21:40.640+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12388689/comment/12665865","id":"12665865","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"After re-reading Kathey's comments in DERBY-3105, I'm tempted to leave the\r\n-ca implementation present, and just remove it from the usage message.
