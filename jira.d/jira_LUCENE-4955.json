the same position (at least for \"front\" edge ngrams!). But embedded ngrams seem more like a stretching out of the token, from one token to a sequence of tokens. Actually, it is k overlayed sequences, where k = maxGramSize minus minGramSize plus 1.\r\n\r\nI think the solution should be to have a \"mode\" which indicates whether the \"intent\" is merely variations (sub-tokens) for the token at the same position vs. a stretching the token into a sequence of tokens. Maybe call it \"expansionMode\": \"stack\" vs. \"sequence\".\r\n\r\nBut even for the latter, I would definitely recommend that each of the k sequences should restart the position at the original token position.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jkrupan","name":"jkrupan","emailAddress":"jack dot krupansky at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jkrupan&avatarId=22774","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jkrupan&avatarId=22774","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jkrupan&avatarId=22774","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jkrupan&avatarId=22774"},"displayName":"Jack Krupansky","active":true},"created":"2013-04-24T17:07:46.908+0000","updated":"2013-04-24T17:07:46.908+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12644385/comment/13641567","id":"13641567","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jpountz","name":"jpountz","emailAddress":"jpountz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520"},"displayName":"Adrien Grand","active":true},"body":"Given that offsets can't go backwards and that tokens in the same position must have the same start offset, I think that the only way to get NGramTokenFilter out of TestRandomChains' exclusion list (LUCENE-4641) is to fix position increments (this issue), change the order tokens are emitted in (LUCENE-3920) and stop modifying offsets?
