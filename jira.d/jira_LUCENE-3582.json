This  would fix this issue. Another thing to maybe fix would be the half-open ranges to correctly handle infinity. In that case a NRQ would never hit NaN (even when half open) but with the above query you could still search for NaN (as a \"point value\").

If the upper/lower bounds == null, it will replace that by infinity and will never match NaN (this was a bug before). If you want to hit NaN with NRQ, you can do that only by directly hitting it using NumericRangeQuery.newFloatRange(\"float\", Float.NaN, Float.NaN, true, true)\r\n\r\nThis patch also handles doubles in addition to floats and uses the native Java method without raw. Tests were modified to check for NaN, too.\r\n\r\nThe use of floatToIntBits instead of floatToRawIntBits has no real performance impact, as this method is only used during indexing. Population of FieldCache is unaffected. It just ensures that indexes are built with normalized NaN values, so NRQ can work correctly.\r\n\r\nStored fields were already stored using the non-raw method, so this is now consistent.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2011-11-19T00:39:09.413+0000","updated":"2011-11-19T11:14:26.781+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12531994/comment/13153426","id":"13153426","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"body":"Looks good to me.
