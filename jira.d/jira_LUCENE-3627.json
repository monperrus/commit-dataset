Would you ever have the case there only one \"segements_N\" file is corrupt 'i.e. 0 size'?\r\n\r\nNo, unless something terrible is going on, such as your IO system\r\ndisregards fsync, you have hardware problems, or something external is\r\nmucking with the index files.\r\n\r\nWhen Lucene commits it writes the next segments_N, fsyncs it (and all\r\nindex file it references) and then removes old commits; so the old\r\ncommits are not removed until the new one is on durable storage.\r\n\r\nI think the conditions for this bug to occur are very rare, ie, lucene\r\ntried to commit, hit a transient IO problem in creating the file (so\r\nthat a 0 byte file is created), your app caught this and called\r\nIW.close, this time the transient IO problem is gone and the close\r\nsucceeds in writing another segments_N file.  At that point you'd hit\r\nthis bug when you next tried to open an IndexWriter on the index.\r\n\r\nThe more common failure would be if the segments_N fails to write (0\r\nbyte file) and then when you close the IW it also fails, ie, because\r\nsomething suddenly is wrong w/ your IO system.  In this case your\r\n\"latest\" segments_N is unreadable, and Lucene handles that fine (falls\r\nback to segments_(N-1), which should be ok because it was fsync'd).\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2011-12-08T19:25:39.055+0000","updated":"2011-12-08T19:25:39.055+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12534241/comment/13165487","id":"13165487","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ken.mccracken","name":"ken.mccracken","emailAddress":"ken dot mccracken at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10438","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10438","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10438","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10438"},"displayName":"Ken McCracken","active":true},"body":"Thank you Mike for cleaning my suggestions up.
