I agree that the terms \"hard\" and \"soft\" aren't very meaningful. However, I don't think that the terms \"full\" and \"partial\" are much better. I think that the defining behavior of the two types of upgrades can be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\no Hard - In this kind of upgrade, on-disk data in the database is changed. This kind of upgrade is NOT reversible. That is, once you hard-upgrade the database, then you can no longer run older versions of the Derby engine jar file against the database. By \"older\", I mean a version with a lower major.minor identifier. In addition, hard upgrade typically enables new features.\r\n\r\no Soft - In this kind of upgrade, on-disk data in the database is NOT changed. If your application misbehaves after this upgrade, you can reverse the upgrade by running your old version of the Derby engine jar. Typically, soft upgrade does not enable new features.\r\n\r\nSo we need a pair of terms which capture these distinctions. Maybe \"feature\" vs. \"bugfix\".\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Rick","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2013-01-31T17:04:10.593+0000","updated":"2013-01-31T17:04:10.593+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12630173/comment/13567816","id":"13567816","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Another approach to the problem might be to eliminate all mention of soft upgrade.
