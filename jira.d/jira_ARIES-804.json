Here after installing the application it runs through getting the JAR file for the EBA and closing the file.  If the use caches is set to true at this point then it will get the same JAR file that was used earlier in the installation process and close it.  However, if use caches is set to false it will create a new JAR file and close that thus leaving the one that was opened during the installation open.\r\n\r\nThere is a timing element to this because if default use caches is false throughout then it won't keep a handle open to the file in the first place and if it is true throughout then the fix to 292 works.  It is only when the value changes from true to false on a separate thread between the installation of the EBA and the tidy up that was added for 292.\r\n\r\nI think this will have a simple fix by adding:\r\n\r\nurlc.setUseCaches(true);\r\n\r\nbefore getting the JAR file in
