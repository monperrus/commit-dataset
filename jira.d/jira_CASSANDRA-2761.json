Then you're not very familiar with the current stability or lack there of of the JDBC driver. \r\n\r\nNo, I guess not, but it can't be any worse on us than for anyone else using it.  A solution that only benefits us doesn't seem very... friendly.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI think the difference in opinion here comes from what determines whether the server and driver should be considered different projects.  I can see where people who feel a high degree of ownership over the code of both, and who by virtue of infrastructure have write access to both, might consider it contrived to treat them as separate projects.  I'm not discounting that point of view, but I do think that's more Social than Technical, and is limited to a relatively small group of Cassandra hackers.\r\n\r\nAs I've said elsewhere, I think it is very important that these drivers be allowed to evolve on their own release schedule with their own versioning that reflects compatibility with a CQL version and not any particular Cassandra version(s).  It's also quite likely, particularly where the driver language != Java that the group of developers is entirely different from those working on the server.  And there is no hard dependency between drivers and Cassandra in either direction (the JDBC->Cassandra dependency is one of convenience).  To me, this pretty solidly points to them being separate projects.\r\n\r\nKeeping them separate won't be as convenient as treating them as one monolithic project, but it's no worse an experience than what other application developers are subjected to.  We should be able to eat our own dog food.\r\n\r\nI also realize that there is more work needed here to decouple the JDBC driver and make this all work better, work that I've volunteered to do.  I haven't had as much time to spend on this lately, but that should be changing RSN.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=urandom","name":"urandom","emailAddress":"eevans at opennms dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031"},"displayName":"Eric Evans","active":true},"created":"2011-08-10T20:53:34.321+0000","updated":"2011-08-10T20:53:34.321+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12509880/comment/13090196","id":"13090196","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tjake","name":"tjake","emailAddress":"jakers at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tjake&avatarId=12744","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tjake&avatarId=12744","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tjake&avatarId=12744","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tjake&avatarId=12744"},"displayName":"T Jake Luciani","active":true},"body":"Is their someway to get a git repo for just drivers? like cassandra.git but cassandra-drivers.git?
