I just let it do it's thing in this regard (to be honest I've just gotten in the habit of ignoring the import section).\r\n\r\nAt least for get_slice, close is properly called (as evident by the patch fixing the problem).   It may be the case that for other calls close is not correctly called, I didn't specifically look for such cases but 1) I haven't noticed a problem making other calls and 2) I didn't notice anything in the code while debugging this issue.\r\n\r\nIn general I agree that self contained objects are better but that doesn't necessarily fit in this case as the open file is really a system resource.  Given the way Java does GC, such resources should be explicitly released.\r\n\r\nI discussed this particular case with jbellis and the thought for the original patch that introduced this bug was that some callers would want to reuse an existing file.  In such a case, they would be responsible for closing the file but that meant that SSTableSliceIterator shouldn't close it out from under them.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mdennis","name":"mdennis","emailAddress":"mdennis at riptano dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matthew F.
