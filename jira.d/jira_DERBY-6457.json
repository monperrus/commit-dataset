It makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n*java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/NetworkServerControlImpl.java:*\r\n\r\nMake writeLDString() write the length in number of bytes instead of number of characters.\r\n\r\n*java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/derbynet/NetworkServerControlApiTest.java:*\r\n\r\nAdd a test case that shuts down the server using credentials that have non-ascii characters in them. The test case hangs indefinitely when run without the fix.\r\n\r\n*java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/SystemPropertyTestSetup.java:*\r\n\r\nReorder how tearDown() restores the old state. Move the engine shutdown so that it's done before the system properties are reset. Since static properties are not re-read until the next time the engine is booted, it makes no difference for subsequent tests whether the properties were actually reset before or after the engine shutdown, as long as they are reset before the next test case boots the engine.\r\n\r\nThe current ordering caused problems because the new test case used a SystemPropertyTestSetup for enabling system-wide BUILTIN authentication. If the system properties are cleared before the engine shutdown in this configuration, there will be no user that's authenticated to do the engine shutdown because all the derby.user.* properties are gone. This made SystemPropertyTestSetup.tearDown() fail with an \"invalid authentication\" error.\r\n\r\nAll the regression tests ran cleanly with the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot
