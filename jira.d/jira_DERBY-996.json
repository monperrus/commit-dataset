This patch modifies only one file:\r\nM      java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\storetests\\st_schema_app.properties\r\n\r\nThe database for st_derby715 test gets created by a previous test (st_schema.sql).  This test was disabled in j2me. The patch removes \"runwithfoundation=false\" from st_schema_app.properties. It adds ij.dataSource.* properties and changes 'database' property to 'ij.database' so that test harness will use the datasource properties when getting the initial connection.\r\n\r\nSomething I noticed when creating this patch is the the test st_schema.sql is empty. It just has the following comment: \r\n-- add the sample database schema\r\n\r\nI am curious to know the purpose of this test. Is it just to create database for the subsequent tests or is it doing something else under the covers? \r\n\r\nWith this patch, I have run storetests suite with j9_foundation VM as well as with Sun JDK 1.4.2. No failures. I would appreciate if a committer can take a look at this patch. Thanks. \r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2006-02-17T04:44:42.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-17T04:44:42.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12329064/comment/12366833","id":"12366833","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"body":"Kathey has committed this patch as svn revision# 378408.
