The fix is to move the ManifestHeserProcessor.split utility method from application utils to aries utils and then make the jmx bundle has a dependency on aries.utils, since the split method is useful and tested thoroughly, designed to be used to split the manifest headers. My impression is that aries.utils is supposed to be the utility bundle for all other bundles. The advantage of this fix is to reduce the code duplication in multiple places and to use the well-tested code:).
