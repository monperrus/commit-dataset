The code used to generate the properties file (affecting propertyText) is doing this replacement: \r\n      String output = input.replaceAll( \"\\n\", \"\\\\\\\\n\" );\r\n    Maybe that will do the trick for the displayText also.\r\n2. Maybe there's a different in the way the \"\\n\" in the static strings versus the println line endings come out.\r\n\r\nI will now attack making the message changes to 10.2. As the MessageBuilder.java is so different from the original ErrorMessageGenerator, and it seemed from looking over JIRA entries and mails to the list that a lot of manual editing was stull done by Laura, I'm going to manually update the 10.2 dita instead of attempting to fix the 10.2 Generator.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2006-11-28T19:43:54.000+0000","updated":"2006-11-28T19:43:54.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12356376/comment/12454215","id":"12454215","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"Attaching a patch for source branches/10.2 that modifies the mentioned ERRORs in 10.2's properties_en.messages, and fixes up 4 test masters.\r\nAlso attaching a patch for docs branches/10.2 which also modifies these mentioned ERRORs into the 10.2 rrefexcept74193.dita, and adds rows for the following messages which were in properties_en.messages, but not in the dita file: \r\n2200W\r\n2850G\r\n42Y26\r\nXBCXU\r\nXBCXV\r\n\r\nran derbyall, and build the ref guide & looked at the resulting doc flavors.
