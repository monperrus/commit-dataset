I therefore think d3343.diff is a correct fix (it should also update the incorrect comment). The tests (derbyall + suites.All) ran cleanly.\r\n\r\nAs to the predicates that are false, I think they could be explained. The default node is replaced with a placeholder node for the auto-generated value during the bind phase, so it is correct that isDefaultColumn() returns false. isAutoincrement() seems to be used for columns that reference an auto-increment column in a table in a select statement, whereas values(default) doesn't actually reference a column in a table. isGenerated() seems to be used for a different kind of generated columns than isAutoincrementGenerated() (aggregated columns and internal helpers like row location columns).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-01-24T09:35:22.335+0000","updated":"2008-01-24T09:35:22.335+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12386914/comment/12562107","id":"12562107","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dyret","name":"dyret","emailAddress":"Dyre dot Tjeldvoll at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dyre Tjeldvoll","active":true},"body":"Given that information, I think I'll merge d3343.diff with a JUnit version of (parts of) the ij-script I uploaded, so that we get a regression test for the fix included in the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dyret","name":"dyret","emailAddress":"Dyre dot Tjeldvoll at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dyre Tjeldvoll","active":true},"created":"2008-01-24T15:47:10.823+0000","updated":"2008-01-24T15:47:10.823+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12386914/comment/12562391","id":"12562391","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dyret","name":"dyret","emailAddress":"Dyre dot Tjeldvoll at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dyre Tjeldvoll","active":true},"body":"Attaching new patch (v2) which fixes the incorrect comment, and adds regression tests.
