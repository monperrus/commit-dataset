Satoor","active":true},"body":"Yip, I did a review of the attached package and following couple questions/comments.\r\n\r\n1)I had question about changes to DropSchemaNode. I realize that my question here is related to pre-existing logic that you needed to extend for drop schema. But I wondered why for table privilege, we push the privilege requirement(select/trigger/update etc) by calling CompilerContext.pushCurrentPrivType and use that to determine what kind of privilege is required for the table in CompilerContextImpl.addRequiredTablePriv method. But for privilege requirement for schemas, we pass the privilege type to CompilerContextImpl.addRequiredSchemaPriv rather than pushing it onto CompilerContext and then popping it back from there at the right time. I should have asked this question when the code was originally checked in for CreateSchemaNode. This is not a biggie, just a curiosity question.\r\n\r\n2)In Authorizer.java, there is a constant called PRIV_TYPE_COUNT which has a value of 7. With the patch attached to this Jira entry, we have added 1 more privilege type. Do we need to change PRIV_TYPE_COUNT? May be the purpose of PRIV_TYPE_COUNT is to track only table and routine level privilege types and that is why we didn't need to modify it for this patch.\r\n\r\n3)Can we have some positive test cases for drop schema in grantRevokeDDL2.sql showing that a database owner or schema owner can successfully drop the schema?\r\n\r\nOther than that, the changes look pretty good to me.

My response to your comments:\r\n\r\n1)  Yes, I noticed that also.  If you look at the CREATE_SCHEMA_PRIV and MODIFY_SCHEMA_PRIV, they are of boolean types and not like the other 7 privilege types which are declared as integers.  So it looks like privilege collection for schema are done abit differently and they were not considered as an integral part of the push/pop privilege logic in compiler context.  (They could be, but its not necessary)  \r\n\r\n2)  The PRIV_TYPE_COUNT should still be 7 since those privilege types(select, insert, update, ..., etc.) are part of  \r\ngrant/revoke statement.  The other schema privileges are used sorely to differentiate what action to take during permission checking time.\r\n\r\n3)  Yes, there is already a testcase to test if database owner can drop the schema.  I believe I have uncommented that part of test in grantRevokeDDL2.sql to re-enable it for this
