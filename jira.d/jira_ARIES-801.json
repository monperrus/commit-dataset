This is just plain silly for the subclassing code, which should already be able to do this trivially and is definitely a bug.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to augment the dynamic interface proxy code so that it can extend \"woven\" abstract classes too, treating any abstract methods as \"interface\" and simply setting the superclass properly. Because the interface generation code extends the existing weaving code this is effectively the same as loading and weaving a real concrete subclass that has zero length implementations of the abstract methods.\r\n\r\nInterestingly it should also be possible to add interfaces to these dynamically generated woven subclasses. I'm not sure whether this will be useful or not, but we should get it for free.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"166213","summary":"Aries Proxy cannot proxy abstract classes","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=timothyjward","name":"timothyjward","emailAddress":"timothyjward at hotmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Ward","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=timothyjward","name":"timothyjward","emailAddress":"timothyjward at hotmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Ward","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":1,"total":1,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12534408/comment/13166018","id":"13166018","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=timothyjward","name":"timothyjward","emailAddress":"timothyjward at hotmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Ward","active":true},"body":"Added to trunk with tests.
