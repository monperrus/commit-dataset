Reduce the amount of code that is generated.\r\n2. Split oversized generated methods into multiple methods.\r\n3. Split oversized generated classes into multiple classes.\r\nWe may want (need) to use all three.\r\n\r\nWe may be able to reduce the amount of generated code by looking for common sub-expressions in the optimized query tree and putting the code for them in separate methods. Or we may be able to reuse intermediate result sets. Perhaps just sharing code for equivalent ProjectResrictNodes and SubQueryNodes would be enough.\r\n\r\nSplitting generated classes may be difficult. Derby assumes that each statement only generates one class. It might be possible to put the byte code for the overflow classes into saved objects of the generated ExecPreparedStatement. The main generated class would load the byte code when needed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jackklebanoff","name":"jackklebanoff","emailAddress":"klebanoff-derby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jack Klebanoff","active":true},"created":"2005-03-24T05:06:52.000+0000","updated":"2005-03-24T05:06:52.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31093/comment/62227","id":"62227","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"large code generation test","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2005-04-06T08:00:59.000+0000","updated":"2005-04-06T08:00:59.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31093/comment/62286","id":"62286","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"body":"Kathey Marsden and myself made a number of changes in IBM's Cloudscape 5.1 codeline to make progress in this area and address an urgent customer issue.
