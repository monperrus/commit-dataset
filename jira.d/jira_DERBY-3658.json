The code that fetches LOBs knows how to handle this, and sets the locator to -1 if locators aren't supported. The patch therefore checks that the locator is valid before it releases it in LOBStateTracker.checkCurrentRow(). Since the locator value is invalid when locators aren't supported, this means that it won't try to call the missing stored procedures.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-05-02T13:07:12.584+0000","updated":"2008-05-02T13:07:12.584+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12395198/comment/12593786","id":"12593786","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"The approach taken seems sound. +1 to commit if the tests pass.\r\n\r\nI missed the point when I implemented this, believing if the server supported locators Cursor.locator would return a valid locator.\r\nDoes it make sense to explicitly note the possibility of an invalid locator even if the server supports it, for instance in [Net]Cursor.locator?\r\nThat said, the possibility of getting INVALID_LOCATOR should of course have made me check the value...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2008-05-02T13:46:00.080+0000","updated":"2008-05-02T13:46:00.080+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12395198/comment/12593842","id":"12593842","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Thanks for looking at the patch, Kristian.
