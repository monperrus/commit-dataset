So, for static indexes, replication doesn't happen and for dynamic indexes, we have to wait until an incremental update of master for slaves to see any commits.\r\n\r\nTracing through the code, it looks like the change that may have effected us was part of [SOLR-3911|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-3911], specifically commenting out the initialization of the newIndexWriter in the replicateAfterStartup block [1]:\r\n{code:java}\r\n// TODO: perhaps this is no longer necessary then?\r\n// core.getUpdateHandler().newIndexWriter(true);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is commented out because it is assumed that indexCommitPoint was going to be set by that block, but when a slave requests commits, that goes back to core.getDeletionPolicy().getCommits() to fetch the list of commits.
