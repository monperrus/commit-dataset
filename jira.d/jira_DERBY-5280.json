However, there's a higher-level cleanup that detects statement severity errors and pops the first statement context it finds if there is one. In this case, where we have nested statement contexts, that causes the parent statement context to be popped. I think it's this higher-level cleanup that's missing when preparing an internal statement fails and that caused the problem seen in DERBY-5161.\r\n\r\nA proper fix for DERBY-5161 might be to get this higher-level cleanup to kick in somehow also for errors when preparing internal statements, or keeping the low-level cleanup added in DERBY-5161 and making the higher-level detect that cleanup has already happened. However, since DERBY-5161 is believed not to be possible after DERBY-5157, it's probably safer to just back out the fix for DERBY-5161 than trying to devise an even more complex fix for something that's most likely not broken.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2011-06-21T14:05:10.312+0000","updated":"2011-06-21T14:05:10.312+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12510497/comment/13052583","id":"13052583","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Thanks for looking into this, Knut. +1 to backing out the previous improvement and not over-rotating on a more involved solution at this time.
