We are working with Lucene 3.2 and we use AnalyzingQueryParser because we need to parse with analyzer every query, even wildcard queries. \r\n\r\nThis works great with most queries, and with the ones that don't work (for example in cases analyzer add/remove words and query have wildcards) we use QueryParser although it doesn't analyze wildcard queries.\r\n\r\nIn our application there are some cases when we need to allow leading wildcard queries, and AnalyzingQueryParser fails although I set to true 'AllowLeadingWildcard' flag. Strings like '*ucene' is converted into WildcardQuery like this 'ucene*'. This is another strange behavior, the ending wildcard.\r\n\r\nI know QueryParser doesn't have this leading wildcard bug, but I need to parse query (I am Spanish and we have special characters (ñ, ü, vocals with accent on them) and we parse indexed data, and to search we need to parse query too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.

Maybe someone that is better with regex like [~steve_rowe] can have a look. If nobody objects after a few days I'm inclined to move forward though.\r\n* What about the case where someone has escaped wildcards? I'm not sure whats even happening today in this case... perhaps it already has surprising behavior and should really be a separate bug, or maybe its working and I just dont see it. I doubt its tested though... but it seems the regex would need to accomodate that?\r\n* The String.format() invocations should probably pass getLocale() from the superclass as the first argument, rather than depending on the default locale.

Also removed the optional backslashes from group 2 (the actual wildcards) - when iterating over wildcardPattern matches, your patch would throw away any number of real wildcards following an escaped wildcard.  I added a test for this.\r\n* When multiple output tokens are produced (and there should only be one), now reporting all of them in the exception message instead of just the first two.\r\n* Removed all references to \"chunklet\" in favor of \"output token\" - this non-standard terminology made the code harder to read.\r\n* Changed descriptions of multiple output tokens to not necessarily be as the result of splitting (e.g. synonyms).\r\n* In {{analyzeSingleChunk()}}, moved exception throwing to the source of problems.\r\n\r\nI also added a {{CHANGES.txt}} entry.  \r\n\r\nTim, let me know if you think my changes are okay - if so, I think it's ready to commit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2013-05-06T07:11:39.145+0000","updated":"2013-05-06T07:11:39.145+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12372906/comment/13649560","id":"13649560","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"body":"One other change I forgot to mention, Tim: I substituted MockAnalyzer where you used StandardAnalyzer in the test code - this allowed me to remove the analyzers-common dependency you introduced (and also the memory dependency, which didn't seem to be used for anything in your patch).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2013-05-06T07:20:08.643+0000","updated":"2013-05-06T07:20:08.643+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12372906/comment/13649670","id":"13649670","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tallison%40mitre.org","name":"tallison@mitre.org","emailAddress":"tallison at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tallison%40mitre.org&avatarId=22768","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tallison%40mitre.org&avatarId=22768","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tallison%40mitre.org&avatarId=22768","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tallison%40mitre.org&avatarId=22768"},"displayName":"Tim Allison","active":true},"body":"Steve, no problem on the delay.
