For AES encryption, we pad the encryption key to a 16 byte boundary. This means that for AES encryption, a 192 bit key is extended to 256 bits. An MD5 digest is appended to the encrypted key. At initial boot time, this digest is computed on the unpadded value. But on subsequent boots, we check the stored digest against a digest computed on the padded value. The reboot fails because the unpadded digest does not equal the padded digest.

Attaching a second rev of the patch which makes the tuple inner class private as you suggested: derby-3710-01-ab-digestPaddedPassword.diff.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why the tests don't work in your environment. One thing I have noticed about this test class is that all sorts of unexpected errors are intercepted in EncryptionAESTest.createAndPopulateDB(). So, for instance, the 192 bit test cases don't run for me under Java 5 because I get an unsupported key length exception on that platform--the test class swallows that exception, skips the test case, and continues merrily along. Have you tried Myrna's repro with and without the patch? Don't bother with my repro: if your platform doesn't support 192 bit encryption, then my repro will fail because of DERBY-4329.\r\n\r\nThe full regression tests ran cleanly for me on Java 5 on my Mac--however, as I noted, on that platform the 192 bit test cases are silently ignored. Those test cases do run correctly for me on the beta Java 6 which I'm running on my Mac and, on that platform, the old-style harness tests run cleanly for me too. However, the full JUnit suite hangs for me on that platform--with and without this patch.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this patch fixes the problem and does not introduce any regressions which I can detect.\r\n\r\nThanks!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2009-07-31T14:02:34.815+0000","updated":"2009-07-31T14:02:34.815+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12397524/comment/12737638","id":"12737638","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"for what it's worth...\r\nThe troublesome thing with encryptionAESTest was that encryption lengths > 128 require unrestricted policy files which don't get installed by default, and aren't available to everyone in the world.
