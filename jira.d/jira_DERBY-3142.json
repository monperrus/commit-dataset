The problem is that to run the tools (not only sysinfo) with different derby.ui.locale values, their classes need to be unloaded, since they store their locale and resource bundles in static fields. This means we either need a class-loader stunt or we need to spawn a new java process to run sysinfo. While spawning a process is not very difficult, making it portable is. If I remember correctly, the old harness contained lots of logic to make sure that the spawning of java processes worked correctly on all supported platforms (not all of which start java processes with a command named \"java\").

Derbyall and suites.All ran cleanly.\r\n\r\nThe test loads the sysinfo class in a separate class loader a number of times with different combinations of default locale and derby.ui.locale. A separate class loader was needed because the tools detect which locale they are running under the first time they are loaded, and they will not detect changes to the locale setting unless the classes are unloaded and then reloaded.\r\n\r\nAlso, the test does not run under a security manager. The reason for this is that the test requires permission to create a class loader. I see in other tests (such as AggregateClassLoadingTest) that we don't want to grant that permission to derbyTesting.jar since then no tests fail if code in derby.jar forgets to use privileged blocks when creating class loaders.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2007-11-22T09:39:46.226+0000","updated":"2007-11-22T09:39:46.226+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12380826/comment/12544950","id":"12544950","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 597610.\r\n\r\nIf this check-in doesn't cause any regression test failures the next few days, I intend to back-port it to 10.3.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2007-11-23T09:20:32.260+0000","updated":"2007-11-23T09:20:32.260+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12380826/comment/12545360","id":"12545360","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Merged to 10.3 with revision 598163.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2007-11-26T08:39:33.694+0000","updated":"2007-11-26T08:39:33.694+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-3142/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i075a7:"}}
