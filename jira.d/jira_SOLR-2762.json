As I was fooling around with my data, it was usually already there.\r\n\r\nI added code to check to see if the key is already present and if so to shift it to the top. I also made a trivial change to the existing code you wrote that was in this condition that changed the order of shrinking the result array before inserting a new LookupResult into the first position. This will avoid ArrayList needlessly growing its array.  As an aside, it's not clear to me why you did a min(10,num) when initializing the ArrayList capacity.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that this code seems overall tricky to test due to all the branch conditions.  And this method probably has a high cyclomatic complexity. It would be nice to move the \"if (exactMatchFirst) {\" branch outside the loops. At a glance it seems doable but then I noticed getExactMatchStartingFromRootArc(i,key) took the loop index 'i' and I'm not sure what the implications are there.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2011-09-16T05:40:06.311+0000","updated":"2011-09-16T05:40:06.311+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523001/comment/13105887","id":"13105887","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"body":"I will review it later today.
