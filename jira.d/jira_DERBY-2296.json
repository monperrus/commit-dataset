This leaves only the setConnectionAttributes method available for creating or shutting down a database. For instance, in Geronimo the getProperties method was previously used to inquire and set whether a create=true was set for a database. \r\nIt would be helpful if ClientDataSource could have the same methods available as EmbeddedDataSource:\r\n setCreateDatabase (String)\r\n getCreateDatabase()\r\n setShutdownDatabase (String)\r\n getShutdownDatabase()\r\n\r\nSYMPTOM\r\nThe getProperties() method is no longer available, nor are alternative methods except the setConnectionAttributes(String) and getConnectionAttributes() methods.\r\n\r\nCAUSE\r\nThe getProperties() method was removed as part of DERBY-446; make ClientDataSource use public getter and setter methods as standard for Java bean properties. It should not have been public.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\n4 new public methods were created for ClientDataSource:\r\n setCreateDatabase (String)\r\n getCreateDatabase()\r\n setShutdownDatabase (String)\r\n getShutdownDatabase()\r\nThese methods should behave similarly to the ones in Embedded, i.e. only valid value for setCreateDatabase is \"create\", and for setShutdownDatabase is \"shutdown\". In essence, at connection time, if set to a valid value, the property is passed on to the server side with the ConnectionAttributes.\r\nNote, that the result for setting contradicting properties for createDatabase and ShutdownDatabase, whether through setCreateDatabase(\"create\") and setShutdownDatabase(\"shutdown\") or via setConnectionAttributes(\"create=true\") or (\"shutdown=true\") is undefined.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND\r\nset and get of ConnectionAttributes can be used to create or shutdown a database.\r\n\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES: none from 10.2.1.6 to 10.3\r\n\r\nREQUIRED CHANGES TO EXISTING APPLICATIONS: there are no required changes. Applications can now use the setCreateDatabase, getCreateDatabase, setShutdownDatabase, and getShutdownDatabase methods with DerbyNetClient as well as with Embedded.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2007-04-23T02:57:53.594+0000","updated":"2007-04-23T02:57:53.594+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12362149/comment/12490768","id":"12490768","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"html version of release note.
