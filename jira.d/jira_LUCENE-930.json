I view this is really a problem with the way contrib dependencies are built and not the main build.xml ... on a clean checkout you should be able to do \"cd contrib/foo; ant test\" and have it automatically build all your dependencies (this already works for the core lucene jar because of the \"build-lucene\" task).  so I made some additions to contrib-build.xml to support this (a \"build-lucene-test\" task), and the spellchecker contrib that needed it.\r\n\r\n3) with Michael's encouragement, i went ahead and removed the \"compile-test-contrib\" target and just made \"build-contrib\" take care of it ... this involved adding a new \"build-jar-and-tests\" since contrib-crawl/subant only support a single target name ... this is much cleaner in my opinion then the old way where build-contrib would just run whatever the 'default' target was for each contrib (which could be named anything, and could do anything) .. now the expected semantics are clearer  (although i'm open torenaming the target)\r\n...but i ran into a slight snag because of the \"javacc-uptodate-check\" init depends on which doesn't work for \"meta-contribs\" like gdata and db that don't have a src dir ... the task even has a TODO that it really only needs to be done for a few contribs, so that looks like a good thing to fix to ... but i've got to run now.  i'll try to update the patch a little later tonight (any feedback in the meantime would be appreciated)\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot

this this patch does...\r\n\r\nHigh Level...\r\n\r\n* \"build-contrib\" now calls a new \"build-artifacts-and-tests\" target\r\n  on every contrib (previously it just called the default target)\r\n  ... any failures in any contrib fail the build.\r\n* \"test-contrib\" now depends on \"build-contrib\" ... along with the\r\n  previous point, this solves addresses the crux of the issue Steven\r\n  noticed.\r\n* By default, the compile-test and test targets of contribs without\r\n  tests do nothing (previously they failed because of a missing directory)\r\n* cleanup of the build files for various contribs so that various\r\n  dependencies work better.\r\n\r\nDetails...\r\n\r\n* changes to contrib-build.xml...\r\n  * add a build-artifacts-and-tests target\r\n  * better support for \"build-lucene\" (executed in proper directory\r\n    now)\r\n  * new support for \"build-lucene-tests\"\r\n  * test and compile-test now do nothing if the contrib has no tests\r\n* changes to gdata-server build.xml...\r\n  * test now depends on compile-test\r\n  * added build-artifacts-and-tests (because it can't import \r\n    contrib-build.xml)\r\n* adds explicit compile-core, compile-test, and\r\n  build-artifacts-and-tests targets to the db build.xml (meta-contrib\r\n  can't use the ones inherited from contrib-build.xml)\r\n* clean up the bdb, bdb-je, and benchmark build.xml files so their\r\n  init targets depend on the contrib-build init target (and doesn't\r\n  skip up to common.init)\r\n* change spellchecker build.xml so it's compile-test depends on\r\n  build-lucene-test (it compiles against English.java)\r\n* main build.xml ...\r\n  * build-contrib now contrib-crawls build-artifacts-and-tests\r\n  * test-contrib depends on build-contrib\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll try to do some more testing of various build target permutations tomorrow -- particularly under java 1.4 -- but i'd appreciate it if other people could try beating on it as well\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot
