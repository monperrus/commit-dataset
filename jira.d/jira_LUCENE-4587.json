You're right the regex is better but probably the 4 chars are ok as this mimics what MockTokenizer will split on.\r\n\r\nWorking on this made me wonder if perhaps WordBreakSpellChecker itself could be made more useful for non-western languages if it was configurable to break/combine with/on characters other than the space.  I have very little of a linguistic background so I'm not sure if there is a solid use-case for this or how would it work.  My guess is it would be too complicated for now if even useful at all.
