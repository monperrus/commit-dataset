It places a bundle in a folder watched by fileinstall. If the bundle is removed in a short manner a deadlock may occur. This issue can occur if a bundles blueprintcontainer is registering services during the create state and the bundle is stopped concurrently. See attached Threaddump. We also attached a sample environment to reproduce the deadlock.\r\n\r\nFor reproduction:\r\n- start the container in debug mode.\r\n- put the com.test.deadlock.1.blueprint-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar into the ./load folder and wait for GRACE_PERIOD state of the blueprint container.\r\n- set breakpoint on line 3205 in class org.apache.felix.framework.Felix.\r\n- put the com.test.deadlock.2.stopper-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar into the ./load folder.\r\n- skip the breakpoint the FIRST time!\r\n- remove the com.test.deadlock.1.blueprint-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar from ./load folder, fileinstall will now remove the bundle, wait a until fileinstall loggs the that.\r\n- resuming now the debugger. This leads to the deadlock and to the attached thread dump.\r\n\r\nRichard S.Hall does describe the problem in the comment here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX-3393?focusedCommentId=13244548&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13244548\r\nYou might consider to register
