This made it impossible to scrub the data directories *after* we find out about the tables but *before* they are initialized.  We were already calling Table.open() in AbstractCassandraDaemon, so I decided to remove the call from DD.\r\n\r\nThat being said, stack traces in logs are still alarming for users.  Since the reason behind FNFE is well understood, I decided to modify ACD.setup() to catch it specifically and emit the error sans trace.  FWIW, CFS.scrubDataDirectories() does seem to be doing its job correctly.\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses those two items.\r\n\r\nOne question I have is if we should detect missing bloom filters and row indexes and proactively rebuild them.  I can't think of a case where this would happen in real life, so this would end up being a courtesy for people manually moving files around.  We probably shouldn't encourage this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gdusbabek","name":"gdusbabek","emailAddress":"gdusbabek at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070"},"displayName":"Gary Dusbabek","active":true},"created":"2010-09-27T06:50:50.385+0000","updated":"2010-09-27T06:50:50.385+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12475000/comment/12915342","id":"12915342","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"I don't know that \"corrupt sstable\" is really that much less scary than a stack trace. :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-09-27T15:55:59.174+0000","updated":"2010-09-27T15:55:59.174+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12475000/comment/12915424","id":"12915424","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"body":"> One question I have is if we should detect missing bloom filters and row indexes and proactively rebuild them.\r\nMight be a cool feature to add at some point: would probably be more useful for recovery of corrupted filters/indexes than for missing ones.\r\n\r\n+1 Looks good.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"created":"2010-09-27T18:45:23.345+0000","updated":"2010-09-27T18:45:23.345+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12475000/comment/12915624","id":"12915624","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gdusbabek","name":"gdusbabek","emailAddress":"gdusbabek at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070"},"displayName":"Gary Dusbabek","active":true},"body":"Committed with a less intimidating error message.
