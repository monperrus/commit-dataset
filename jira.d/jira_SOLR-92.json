Node.ATTRIBUTE_NODE case so it is treated the same as TEXT_NODE and it\r\n: : works for resin and the tests pass.\r\n:\r\n: Hmmm... yeah, this seems to be a mistake in the DOM-Level-3-Core\r\n: description of what getText is suppose to do ... it says that for\r\n: ATTRIBUTE_NODE you should concat all of the children -- but how would an\r\n: ATTRIBUTE ever have children?\r\n\r\nDid some more reading ... according to DOM-Level-3-Core, an Attr's allowed\r\nchildren are \"Text\" and \"EntityReference\".\r\n\r\nXerces2-j NodeImpl..getTextContent duplicates the table from the\r\nLevel-3-Core docs (which is also in the java 1.5 javadocs for\r\norg.w3c.dom.Node.getTextContent()) which the notable exception that they\r\nmove ATTRIBUTE_NODE down into the second row (indicating nodeValue should\r\nbe used instead of concating the children) ... the impl backs this up\r\n(AttrImpl inherits getTextContent from NodeImpl, which by default returns\r\nthis.getNodeValue())\r\n\r\nhttp://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/javadocs/xerces2/org/apache/xerces/dom/NodeImpl.html#getTextContent()\r\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/org/w3c/dom/Node.html#getTextContent()\r\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xerces/java/trunk/src/org/apache/xerces/dom/AttrImpl.java?view=markup\r\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xerces/java/trunk/src/org/apache/xerces/dom/NodeImpl.java?view=markup\r\n\r\nFortunately, the DOM Spec says that accessing the Attr.nodeValue is\r\ndefined to be Attr.value, which is documented as...\r\n\r\n        On retrieval, the value of the attribute is returned as a string.\r\n        Character and general entity references are replaced with their values.\r\n\r\n...so even if someone out there is acctually obeying the spec about\r\ngiving Attr's child nodes, we should still be safe using getNodeValue in\r\nthe Node.ATTRIBUTE_NODE case since the spec says that needs to work too.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n...i'll commit this change along with some more comments explaining
