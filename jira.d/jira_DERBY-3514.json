commands if an exception is thrown the network socket is never closed (left to garbage collection).\r\nMost likely the longer wait that NetworkServerTestSetup had was enough time to get the socket closed and thus freed up for the network server to use.\r\n\r\nI accidentally committed a reduced wait time in NetworkServerTestSetup yesterday while working on DERBY-3504.\r\nI plan on leaving this reduced time (10 seconds to start the server rather than the old 300 seconds)  as the server should come up in that time and my belief is that extending the time is really just hiding bugs (like this one).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot
