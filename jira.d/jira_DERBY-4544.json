This patch makes the repro behave correctly. I will run regression tests. More tests need to be written to verify that other generation expressions work on streaming Clobs.\r\n\r\nThe SQLClob.getLength() method is a little tricky. It ends up calling getStreamWithDescriptor(). That method has a prominent comment saying that it doesn't expect to be called more than once--which happens if your generation clause invokes the length() function on a streaming Clob.\r\n\r\nThere is no SQLBlob.getLength() method. Instead, if you call the length() function on a streaming Blob, you will get the getLength() behavior of the superclass, which materializes the Blob.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to make SQLClob.getLength() first check whether it is operating on a non-resetable stream. If the stream is not resetable, then the assumptions of getStreamWithDescriptor() will be violated. For non-resetable streams, SQLClob.getLength() will just do what Blobs do, i.e., defer to the getLength() method in the superclass which materializes the Clob.\r\n\r\nThis will be inefficient--but that is better than causing a data corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nTouches the following files:\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/SQLClob.java\r\n\r\n1 line fix to force materialization if getLength() is called on a non-resetable stream.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nA      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/DummyReader.java\r\nM      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/ClobTest.java\r\n\r\nTest case demonstrating the fix.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2011-04-11T14:49:31.467+0000","updated":"2011-04-11T14:49:31.467+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12455894/comment/13018399","id":"13018399","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Attaching a new version of the repro. This experiments with additional generation expressions. The additional expressions test the builtin substr, locate, upper, and trim functions as well as a user-written function. In all of these cases, Derby behaves correctly. It appears to me that length() was the only builtin function which caused this bug. For other Derby builtin functions (and user-written functions), Derby materializes the Clob. This gives me some assurance that the solution, although inefficient, makes Derby behave in a regular way. I will incorporate these additional tests into the new test case.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2011-04-11T15:52:22.753+0000","updated":"2011-04-11T15:52:22.753+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12455894/comment/13018426","id":"13018426","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Tests passed cleanly for me on derby-4544-01-ab-shortCircuitLengthOptimization.diff.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2011-04-11T16:49:15.846+0000","updated":"2011-04-11T16:49:15.846+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12455894/comment/13018519","id":"13018519","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Attaching a new version of the patch, derby-4544-01-ac-shortCircuitLengthOptimization.diff.
