But FilterAtomicReader only says this for numDocs and maxDoc and calls it on hasDeletions!\r\n* default implementation in SegmentReader uses liveDocs != null: but i dont know anything checking (e.g. CheckIndex should do this) that the codec's LiveDocsFormat must return null (vs a Bits matching all docs). We should check this if there is code actually making this (undocumented) assumption.\r\n\r\nFor SegmentReader at least, it seems to be better if it had this implementation: and neither numDocs() and maxDocs() calls ensureOpen() either so I only see it as a safer way to go (we could avoid the sketchy liveDocs != null, but i bet other code elsewhere relies on this too).\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nisn't the default impl of TermsEnum.termState dangerous?
