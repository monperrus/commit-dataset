It used to be an error. This basically means 'q' isn't required and q.alt=*:* is redundant.

Hoss: I don't agree with your reasoning on the developer-user typo-ing the 'q' parameter. If you mistype basically any parameter then clearly it is as if you didn't even specify that parameter and you get the default behavior of the parameter you were trying to type correctly but didn't. \r\n\r\nunderstood ... but most other situations the \"default\" behavior is either \"do nothing\" or \"error\" ... we don't have a lot of default behaviors which are \"give me tones of stuff\" ... if you use {{facet=true&faceet.field=foo}} (note the extra character) you don't silently get get faceting on every field as a default -- you get no field faceting at all. if you misstype the q param name and get an error on your first attempt you immediately understand you did something wrong.  likewise if we made the default a \"matches nothing\" query, then you'd get no results and (hopefully) be suspicious enough to realize you made a mistake -- but if we give you a bunch of results by default you may not realize at all that you're looking at all results not just the results of what you thought the query was.  the only situations i can think of where forgetting or mistyping a param name doens't default to error or nothing are things with fixed expectations: start, rows, fl, etc...  Those have defaults that (if they don't match what you tried to specify) are immediately obvious ... the 'start' attribute on the docList returned is wrong, you get more results then you expected, you get field names you know you didn't specify, etc...  it's less obvious when you are looking at the results of a query that it's a match-all query instead of the query you thought you were specifying.\r\n\r\nlike i said ... i'm -0 to having a hardcoded default query for lucene/dismax/edismax ... if you feel strongly about it that's fine, allthough i would try to convince you \"match none\" is a better hardcoded default then 'match all' (so that it's easier to recognize mistakes quickly) and really don't think we should do it w/o also add q.alt support to the LuceneQParser so people can override it.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2012-03-26T16:36:25.619+0000","updated":"2012-03-26T16:36:25.619+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12384531/comment/13238560","id":"13238560","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ryantxu","name":"ryantxu","emailAddress":"ryantxu at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ryan McKinley","active":true},"body":"bq. if no query string is supplied, or if its blank or just whitespace, then the default is to match all documents.\r\n\r\n-0\r\n\r\nWhen I opened this issue (4 years ago!)

I just have problems with the fact they kind of do this today.  Both DisMaxQParser and ExtendedDisMaxParser check the q.alt parameter when the string given to them is null.
