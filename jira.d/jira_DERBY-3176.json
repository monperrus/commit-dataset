Just adding a new id without modifying the rest of the code to handle this new type of id will not work.\r\n\r\nThere are modules that will work in J2ME CDC/Foundation 1.1 and J2SE 1.4, they indicate this by specifying their jdk level as 4 in modules.properties. Any module that requires classes that are in J2SE 1.4 and not in the J2ME subset indicate this by explicitly stating they need that class: E.g.\r\n\r\nderby.module.jdbcJ4=org.apache.derby.jdbc.Driver30\r\nderby.env.jdk.jdbcJ4=4\r\nderby.env.classes.jdbcJ4=java.sql.Driver\r\n\r\nThe order of the id (jdk levels) is also significant, for any two modules that can run in a given environment, the one with the highest jdk id will be selected and currently the code works in that they are the base jdk levels. Inserting values in the middle for J2ME I think has the potential to lead to confusion, especially when migrating changes across branches. E.g. for the J2ME based upon Java 5, what would a new id be, since there is no gap between J2SE_142 and J2SE_15.\r\n\r\nFeel free to implement a different scheme, but it will require more than just adding an id in JVMInfo.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"created":"2007-11-07T18:49:34.205+0000","updated":"2007-11-07T18:57:13.563+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12381918/comment/12540920","id":"12540920","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the continued advice, Dan.
