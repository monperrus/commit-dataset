In this patch, we're patching DatabasePropertyTestSetup.java unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n2) Why do we need to import java.util.Properties into ResultSetsFromPreparedStatementTest.java?\r\n\r\nIn the end, is SysinfoTest.java the only one that needs to be changed? If so and if no one else objects, I'm going to change the patch to remove the unnecessary chunks and commit it.\r\n\r\nI should also mention (and Siddharth, in the future it's also good practice to do so on JIRA upon posting a patch) that regressions were ran (suites.All) for this patch and it succeeded without any failures.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAs for what you mentioned about creating a test to check whether the default values have been reset, I think that can be very difficult. The main challenge is: *when* do you run this test? Would you run it after every single test in JUnit? That would be incredibly time consuming.\r\n\r\nSince these are just tests, we usually just trust that: if suites.All passes, then all the values are being reset, or if they aren't, it's not serious enough that it is not making the whole suite collapse.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=espinha","name":"espinha","emailAddress":"tiago dot derby at espinhas dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tiago R.
