Derbyall, suites.All and the compatibility test passed with\r\nthe patch.\r\n\r\nIn the current code, when an exception happens on the server, the\r\nserver always sends an SQLCARD with SQLCODE=-1, and this value is used\r\nas error code when the client generates the SQLException.\r\n\r\nSimply changing the server to send the actual error code in the\r\nSQLCODE field wouldn't work, though, since the client uses the sign of\r\nthe SQLCODE to tell whether the condition is a warning or an error.\r\nPositive values are interpreted as warnings, and negative as errors.\r\n\r\nThe client doesn't depend on the negative value being -1, so we could\r\nsend any negative value to tell that an error occurred. The patch\r\nexploits this by encoding the always non-negative error code seen on\r\nthe server as a negative value in the SQL code:\r\n\r\n  sqlCode = -errorCode - 1\r\n\r\nWhen the client generates an SQLException, it can convert the SQL code\r\nback to the original error code:\r\n\r\n  errorCode = -sqlCode - 1\r\n\r\nMore detailed description of the changes:\r\n\r\n* drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/DRDAConnThread.java\r\n\r\n  - Push down some of the logic that determines the SQLCODE from\r\n    writeSQLCAGRP() to getSqlCode().\r\n\r\n  - Make getSqlCode() return the error code encoded in a negative\r\n    integer if the exception represents an error.\r\n\r\n  - Remove unused severity parameter in writeSQLCARD().\r\n\r\n* client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Sqlca.java\r\n\r\n  - Added getErrorCode() method to convert SQL code to error code.\r\n\r\n  - Promote STATEMENT_SEVERITY errors to TRANSACTION_SEVERITY errors\r\n    if the connection is in auto-commit mode. This is needed in order\r\n    to match the error codes returned by the embedded driver in\r\n    auto-commit (see TransactionResourceImpl.handleException() for the\r\n    corresponding code in the engine). (This does not happen\r\n    automatically otherwise because the server-side connection is\r\n    never auto-commit, even if the client-side connection is.)\r\n\r\n  - getUnformattedMessage() now shows the error code instead of the\r\n    SQL code.\r\n\r\n* client/org/apache/derby/client/am/SqlException.java\r\n\r\n  - If the exception is generated from an SQLCA, use getErrorCode()\r\n    instead of getSqlCode() to initialize the error code.\r\n\r\n* client/org/apache/derby/client/am/SQLExceptionFactory40.java\r\n\r\n  - Check for error code only if the sub-class of SQLException cannot\r\n    be determined from the SQL state. (I don't know why the original\r\n    code checked the error code in the first place. The embedded\r\n    driver only looks at the SQL state.) Now that the error code is\r\n    something else than -1, the early checks for error code for\r\n    example made syntax errors that happened in auto-commit mode\r\n    (whose error codes match TRANSACTION_SEVERITY) would be returned\r\n    as SQLTransactionRollbackExceptions instead of\r\n    SQLSyntaxErrorExceptions.\r\n\r\n* testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/testclientij.out\r\n\r\n  - Update master to expect the correct error codes.\r\n\r\n*  testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/BaseJDBCTestCase.java\r\n\r\n  - Added helper method that checks the error code.\r\n\r\n* testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/derbynet/BadConnectionTest.java\r\n\r\n  - Expect the correct error code.\r\n\r\n* testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/J2EEDataSourceTest.java\r\n\r\n  - Use new helper method to check error codes.\r\n\r\n* testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/ErrorCodeTest.java\r\n\r\n  - Enable for client/server.\r\n\r\n* testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/replicationTests/ReplicationRun.java\r\n* testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/replicationTests/ShutdownMaster.java\r\n* testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/replicationTests/ShutdownSlave.java\r\n\r\n  - Expect correct error codes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-05-25T10:20:13.677+0000","updated":"2012-05-25T10:20:13.677+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12368475/comment/13283288","id":"13283288","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"One note about client/server compatibility.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, a transaction-severity error happens on the server,\r\nthe server sees an exception whose getErrorCode() method returns\r\n30000. Here's what getErrorCode() on the client-side exception will\r\nreturn for the various combinations of new and old servers and\r\nclients:\r\n\r\n(old server, old client) -> -1\r\n(old server, new client) -> 0\r\n(new server, old client) -> -30001\r\n(new server, new client) -> 30000\r\n\r\n(\"old\" means any version without the fix, \"new\" means any version with\r\nthe fix)\r\n\r\nWith an old server and a new client, 0 is returned because the old\r\nservers always send SQLCODE -1, and the client converts that to an\r\nerror code by adding one and changing the sign. Since 0 matches\r\nExceptionSeverity.NO_APPLICABLE_SEVERITY (intended for \"when the\r\nsystem was unable to determine the severity\"), I think it's slightly\r\nless wrong than -1. But if someone thinks returning -1, as we did\r\nbefore, is better, and that it's worthwhile adding logic to handle\r\nthat, it should be possible to change it.\r\n\r\nWith a new server and an old client, the server will send an SQLCODE\r\nthat encodes the original error code, but the client doesn't know how\r\nto transform that back to an error code, and will return the SQLCODE\r\nunchanged (-30001). Again, it should be possible to make the server\r\nsend SQLCODE -1 when it's talking to an old client. However, since we\r\ndon't document the error codes, and since -30001 is no more or less\r\ncorrect than -1 (they're both wrong), I'm not sure if it's worth\r\nadding special handling of this case.
