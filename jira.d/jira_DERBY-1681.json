The test changed as part of the DERBY-1633 checkins and thus the patch had to be re-synced.\r\n\r\nNote that the test cases which were added for DERBY-1633 actually already demonstrate the problem reported (and now fixed) in this issue.  However, I don't think it hurts to have a dedicated test case, so I still think  it would be good to commit d1681_tests_v2.patch to the trunk and 10.2 codelines (those are the codelines into which the fix for this issue has already been comitted).\r\n\r\nI'm also working to port DERBY-1633 to 10.1; when that's done, the test patch for this issue should be ported to 10.1, as well.\r\n\r\nThis is test-only patch: d1681_test_v2.patch is ready for commit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2006-08-25T22:55:55.000+0000","updated":"2006-08-25T22:55:55.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12347828/comment/12430803","id":"12430803","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"I will look at committing these test changes to trunk and 10.2","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2006-08-26T23:46:32.000+0000","updated":"2006-08-26T23:46:32.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12347828/comment/12430868","id":"12430868","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"committed d1681_test_v2.patch to trunk:\r\n\r\nm1_142:27>svn commit\r\n\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\master\\predicatePushdown.out\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\lang\\predicatePushdown.sql\r\nTransmitting file data ..\r\nCommitted revision 437380.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2006-08-27T15:09:01.000+0000","updated":"2006-08-27T15:09:01.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12347828/comment/12430907","id":"12430907","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"backported and committed patch d1681_test_v2.patch from trunk to 10.2 branch:\r\n\r\nr437487 | mikem | 2006-08-27 17:34:07 -0700 (Sun, 27 Aug 2006) | 14 lines\r\n\r\nDERBY-1681\r\nmerging change 437380 from trunk to 10.2 branch:\r\n\r\nDERBY-1691\r\ncontributed by Army Brown\r\n\r\nAdding extra tests for this issue, fix already committed.\r\n\r\nNote that the test cases which were added for DERBY-1633 actually already\r\ndemonstrate the problem reported (and now fixed) in this issue.
