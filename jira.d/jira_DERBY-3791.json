The results are \"normalized\", where the throughput obtained with 10.2.2.1 is defined as 100%.\r\n\r\n100% 100% 10.2.2.1\r\n075% 216% 10.3.3.0\r\n079% 231% 10.4.1.3\r\n078% 231% trunk\r\n146% 394% trunk-buffer-fix\r\n167% 456% trunk-StringClob-fix\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, we do have a regression when using one client. The results obtained with SingleRecordSelectClient are a bit different than those I saw with the LobPerf repro posted under DERBY-3312. This might be because the repro doesn't commit after each select, but SingleRecordSelectClient does. This can cause the list of open Clobs to get large and might further reduce the performance.\r\n\r\nI've played with two fixes. One is really simple, where one buffer is removed and another one is adjusted according to the Clob size. Without the fix, we allocated at least 32KB character buffers for each Clob. Needless to say, this is quite a lot when the Clob itself has between one and five characters.\r\n\r\nThe second fix adds another InternalClob implementation, which I have called StringClob. This is used for Clobs that are too small to be represented as streams. Currently these Clobs are represented as a byte array in memory. It turns out we start out with a byte array (from store), convert it to a string, convert it back to a byte array and then finally we convert whatever data the user requests to strings again.\r\nAdding yet another internal Clob representation is not exactly good regarding testing and code volume, but because it is so simple I consider doing it for the extra performance.\r\n\r\nBefore I continue working on the StringClob fix, I want to clean up the InternalClob interface slightly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2008-07-22T11:24:24.028+0000","updated":"2008-07-22T11:24:24.028+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12400722/comment/12616819","id":"12616819","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"'derby-3791-1a-buffer_fix.diff' makes UTF8Reader allocate a smaller buffer if possible.\r\nThe following alternatives are considered (if possible):\r\n - length of the byte stream (if available)\r\n - the maximum allowed length for the field (if set)\r\n - the maximum size of the buffer\r\n\r\nIn addition, the buffering of the internal stream is removed because it is already buffered at lower levels.\r\n\r\nNote that the buffer can still be too large because we get information about the size in number of bytes.
