For example, the subsystem being uninstalled may have a reference to a bundle that's a dependency provisioned to (i.e. is a constituent of) another subsystem. If the reference count is zero, the constituent relationship between the bundle and the other subsystem should be removed. Note that the subsystem being uninstalled may be the \"provisioned to\" subsystem if it accepts dependencies. The reference count cannot always be relied upon, however. In the case of an unscoped subsystem being uninstalled that shares a bundle with another unscoped subsystem, the reference count will not be zero but the constituent relationship should be removed nevertheless.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken in this patch attempts to cover all possibilities by always removing the constituent relationship between the subsystem being acted upon (i.e. the subsystem being uninstalled) and the bundle. There is no harm done if the relationship does not actually exist. Then, if the resource is uninstallable (i.e. reference count equals zero), the constituent relationship between the \"provisioned to\" subsystem and the bundle is removed. There is no harm done if the \"provisioned to\" subsystem turns out to be the same subsystem as the one being acted upon.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jwross%40us.ibm.com","name":"jwross@us.ibm.com","emailAddress":"jwross at us dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Ross","active":true},"created":"2012-08-09T13:03:21.933+0000","updated":"2012-08-09T13:03:21.933+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ARIES-902/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i07hg7:"}}
