You were switching several such methods from public to package-private, which is a no-op and prompted my comment.  On the other-hand, if the class is ever made public, it may be useful to have its intended public API pre-declared, and, even if it's never made public, declaring some methods public has some documentation value.  In general, the style I prefer is try to declare fields and methods as though each class were public.  Package-private methods and fields are really only required for classes that actually are public but that wish to hide some things from all but others in their package.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine point, and doesn't warrant too much analysis.  I probably should have just held my tongue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","emailAddress":"cutting at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true},"created":"2007-02-23T17:50:56.300+0000","updated":"2007-02-23T17:50:56.300+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363380/comment/12475436","id":"12475436","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Ahhh, OK, I see.
