Or has the philosophy changed?\r\nIf set_keyspace() is to be used, it should be the one returning an AccessLevel. login() should return void. In other words, the AccessLevel is per-keyspace, not per-user.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI remember; what has changed is (anecdotal) experience with how people are (or more importantly are not) using this, and how well the interface is holding up over time (read: it's not).\r\n\r\nPersonally,  I am  stronger in my convictions now that we should _not_ be rolling our own AAA, that this is not The Way, and I am seeking to make this (still experimental) API as optional as possible while working toward something better, (AVRO-341).\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nAlso, login() should no longer throw AuthorizationException since it doesn't do authorization, while set_keyspace() should throw it.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n{{set_keyspace()}} is the required call now, {{login()}} works exactly as before only it uses the keyspace specified in {{set_keyspace()}} instead of having one passed in (and {{set_keyspace()}} invalidates any previous {{login()}}).\r\n\r\nThis was the whole point of this issue, to divorce the function of assigning a keyspace from authentication.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nPlease let me know if I need to implement these changes or if someone else will do it or if there are any questions.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI don't see any changes that need to be implemented here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=urandom","name":"urandom","emailAddress":"eevans at opennms dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031"},"displayName":"Eric Evans","active":true},"created":"2010-05-04T16:01:28.265+0000","updated":"2010-05-04T16:02:49.972+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12463043/comment/12863868","id":"12863868","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tzz","name":"tzz","emailAddress":"tzz at lifelogs dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Zlatanov","active":true},"body":"Thanks for explaining.
