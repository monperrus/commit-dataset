If you want the node to read your local changes to schema.yaml you need to provide a number or tag greater than what it has, or it'll just be ignored. Thus you could put the same file everywhere, with the same ID... it propagates through the system but it's simply ignored by nodes that already have read the schema defined by that ID.
