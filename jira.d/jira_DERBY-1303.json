In my opinion, more can be done to make it more \"JUnit friendly\".\r\nThat said, I also observe that our JUnit environment lacks some supporting functionality. I might take some time to work on the test, but first I have a few questions.\r\n\r\n1) Is the test supposed to be runnable through it's main method?\r\n\r\n2) Do we need support for starting, and shutting down, a network server from a JUnit test?\r\nWhere should this functionality be placed? As a subclass of BaseJDBCTestCase, or in an independent/existing utility class?\r\nTwo cases:\r\na) In same process; is doable. If things go wrong, server dies with the VM.\r\nb) In separate process; more complicated. If the test hangs/fails the server process can be left running. This is similar to the existing NetServer, but here server management is done by the harness, not the test process itself (exception; useprocess=false).\r\n\r\n3) Can someone confirm or deny that we have recommended to place JUnit tests in the same directory structure as the other tests?\r\n\r\nI know of two JUnit tests that require a server to be explicitly started and manipulated \"outside the harness\": SuicideOfStreaming and the tests for Connection.isValid().","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2006-05-29T21:09:55.000+0000","updated":"2006-05-29T21:09:55.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12333352/comment/12413728","id":"12413728","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=naka","name":"naka","emailAddress":"tomonaka at basil dot ocn dot ne dot jp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tomohito Nakayama","active":true},"body":"Hello.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts are as next...\r\n\r\n1) \r\nTests may be runnable as independent program , but not needed to be.\r\n\r\nNow we have *.junit support in our test framework, then runnablitily of each tests is not needed.\r\nHowever, there are no need to prohibit it.\r\n\r\n\r\n2)\r\nYes.
