Here're the changes:\r\n\r\n  * Only one addIndexes can run at once, so call to 2nd or more\r\n    addIndexes just blocks until the one is done.\r\n\r\n  * close() and rollback() wait for any running addIndexes to finish\r\n    and then blocks new addIndexes calls\r\n\r\n  * commit() waits for any running addIndexes, or any already running\r\n    commit, to finish, then quickly takes a snapshot of the segments\r\n    and syncs the files referenced by that snapshot.  While syncing is\r\n    happening addIndexes are then allowed to run again.\r\n\r\n  * optimize() is allowed to run concurrently with addIndexes; the two\r\n    simply wait for their respective merges to finish.\r\n\r\nI think we should not make any API promises about what it means when\r\nthese methods (commit, close, rollback, optimize, addIndexes) are\r\ncalled concurrently from different threads, except that the methods\r\nall work correctly, IndexWriter won't throw an errant exception, and\r\nyour index won't become corrupt.\r\n\r\nI made one additional change which is technically a break in backwards\r\ncompatibility, but I think (?) a minor acceptable one: I no longer\r\nallow the same Directory to be passed into addIndexes* more than once.\r\nThis was necessary because we identify a SegmentInfo by its\r\nDirectory/name pair, and passing in the same Directory allowed dup\r\nSegmentInfo instances to enter SegmentInfos, which is dangerous.\r\n\r\nI'll wait a few days before committing.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2008-08-05T10:08:40.812+0000","updated":"2008-08-05T10:08:40.812+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12400145/comment/12619890","id":"12619890","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"{quote}I think we should not make any API promises about what it means when\r\nthese methods (commit, close, rollback, optimize, addIndexes) are\r\ncalled concurrently from different threads, except that the methods\r\nall work correctly, IndexWriter won't throw an errant exception, and\r\nyour index won't become corrupt.{quote}\r\n\r\nAgree... higher level synchronization by the user is the right way to ensure/enforce an ordering.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2008-08-05T14:14:28.626+0000","updated":"2008-08-05T14:14:28.626+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12400145/comment/12620713","id":"12620713","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"I've just started reviewing this patch.\r\nSince doWait() can return after 1 sec, the pattern is to use a while loop with the condition that caused it to be called.\r\nBut in some cases, it's hard to tell if the code is correct.... for example copyExternalSegments() is hard because of the other non-trival code code in the loop where  it's not clear if it's safe/correct to call that code again.

We no longer need to check for isExternal in CMS's merge() method -- we can run all merges in the BG.  In fact I think it's no longer necessary to even compute & record isExternal (this was its only use).  Hmmm, except when I take this out I'm seeing testAddIndexOnDiskFull hang.

The hang I was seeing before was because as each\r\nBG thread hit the disk-full exception (in the test), it would abort\r\nthat thread, and eventually no threads were doing merges even though\r\nmerges were still pending.  So copyExternalSegments would then\r\nwait forever.\r\n\r\nThe fix was simple: I changed resolveExternalSegments (renamed from\r\ncopyExternalSegments) to pick up any pending merges that involve\r\nexternal segments and run the merge itself, only falling back to the\r\n\"wait\" call when all such merges were already in progress in CMS.\r\nThis way the disk full error is hit in the FG and the transaction (in\r\naddIndexesNoOptimize) unwinds.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2008-08-26T16:06:37.889+0000","updated":"2008-08-26T16:06:37.889+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12400145/comment/12626158","id":"12626158","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ningli","name":"ningli","emailAddress":"ning dot li dot li at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ning Li","active":true},"body":"Maybe this should be a separate JIRA issue.
