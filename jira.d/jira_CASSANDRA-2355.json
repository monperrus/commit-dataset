The idea would be to perhaps replace FBUtilities.getComparator() with a ComparatorFactory that could be passed something like \"UUIDType(restrictTo=time,sort=desc)\" and parse out the parameters in order to construct the instance.  For Cassandra-2231, the proposed patch requires that FBUtilities.getComparator() caches and returns the same singleton comparator instances, so that requesting \"UUIDType\" will always return the same instance.  It would be necessary to cache the parameterized version in a similar way, and would probably need to be able to know that \"UUIDType(restrictTo=time,sort=desc)\" and \"UUIDType(sort=desc,restrictTo=time)\" should return the same cached comparator.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=edanuff","name":"edanuff","emailAddress":"edanuff at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=edanuff&avatarId=17936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=edanuff&avatarId=17936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=edanuff&avatarId=17936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=edanuff&avatarId=17936"},"displayName":"Ed Anuff","active":true},"created":"2011-03-18T16:45:19.401+0000","updated":"2011-03-18T16:45:19.401+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12501797/comment/13009132","id":"13009132","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slebresne","name":"slebresne","emailAddress":"sylvain at datastax dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630"},"displayName":"Sylvain Lebresne","active":true},"body":"Attaching patch against 0.7.\r\n\r\nIt may be important to keep in mind that once you use a comparator with arguments, your node become network incompatible with older nodes, since those older nodes won't be able to understand the comparator shipping in new schema migrations.

Are there any other uses for comparator options?\r\n\r\nThe idea was to allow reversed comparator, and the composite types and more importantly both those together. In particular this improves slightly I believe the parsing for the composite types themselves. The fact that it is generic also makes use usable for custom comparator. There was also some idea of generalizing existing comparator hinted in the comment above. But for exemple, we could easily have a TextComparator(charset='whatever'), which could be cool. Or a TextComparator(regexp='...') who would validate only entry matching some regexp. Maybe that last one is not so useful, I don't know, but I do believe that it opens a bunch of interesting possibility.
