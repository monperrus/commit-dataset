With it removed, recursiveGetNodes() can be rewritten to be remarkably simpler and combined with the Point specialization of this method into one.  I've already done this locally and the code is easier to read and debug.  However the optimization is probably a noticeable benefit for the TermQuery strategy.  Perhaps this implementation could move to TermQueryPrefixTreeStrategy.  Alternatively it would be cool if the nodes could be pruned after the fact (in the strategy) but that would be hard since nodes are flattened into a list.  I'm leaning towards moving this implementation to the strategy where I can see ways it could even be optimized more by bubbling this pruning up from now only the bottom level but up additional levels.

It becomes exponentially less likely to happen as you move up but it can and will happen.\r\n* The TermQuery strategy won't simplify at index time (this is a change) and will simplify at search time.  Note indexed non-point shapes will use ~20% more disk.\r\n* The RecursivePrefixTree strategy will continue to simplify indexed shapes. It has a search-time algorithm that doesn't use PrefixTree.getNodes().\r\n* Simplified the API subclassing contract for SpatialPrefixTree, and thus removed an overriding method in both Geohash & Quad implementations.\r\n\r\np.s.
