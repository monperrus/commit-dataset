However, the CPU usage is more like 0% than 100%. I\r\nthink this is caused by the pre-fetching that was added to the network\r\nclient in DERBY-822. If you put this at the end of values1.inc\r\n\r\n    readReplyDss\r\n    readLengthAndCodepoint QRYDTA\r\n    skipBytes\r\n\r\nor simply\r\n\r\n    skipDss\r\n\r\ntestProtocol will terminate successfully. \r\n\r\nThis is not a compatibility issue, since the network client (also the\r\n10.1 client) knows that a QRYDTA object may or may not arrive. The\r\nprotocol test, on the other hand, is written with a specific version\r\nof the server in mind, with the expected server response\r\nhard-coded. Since the 10.1 version of the test doesn't expect QRYDTA\r\nfrom an OPNQRY, the actual server response and the expected response\r\nwill be out of sync.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what causes the hang, though. The test that is hanging is\r\n\"Test for too large value for OUTEXP in EXCSQLSTT\", and it happens in\r\nthe first skipDss in connect.inc. When this test starts, there is at\r\nleast a left-over QRYDTA from the previous test (and perhaps more\r\nsince that one doesn't read any data sent from the server). But that\r\nshould not be a problem since the endTest command is supposed to close\r\nthe socket and streams and open new ones. We should probably look into\r\nwhy this is happening, at least so that we can eliminate that there's\r\nsomething wrong with the network server code.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-06-17T23:55:45.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-17T23:55:45.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12344542/comment/12416631","id":"12416631","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Comment from Knut Anders on derby-dev:\r\n\r\nIt seems like the hang is in fact caused by a bug in\r\nDDMReader. dssIsChainedWithDiffID and dssIsChainedWithSameID are not\r\nreset in initialize(), so values from a previous session might be\r\nused.

When you are running derbynetclientmats with the configuration you have described in http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/TestingOldClientNewServer, testProtocol from the 10.1 derbyTesting.jar is used, but it extends the TestProto class found in the 10.2 derbynet.jar, which again uses DDMReader/DDMWriter in the 10.2 derbynet.jar to communicate with the server. So, in a way, you are running 10.2 network server code both on the client side and on the server side, but the actual commands are read from 10.1 test code. Does this make you less confused? :)\r\n\r\nNote that I'm pretty sure this particular hang cannot occur in the network server itself. When a new session is started, DRDAConnThread.processCommands() begins a loop reading commands and writing responses. It always calls DDMReader.readDssHeader() before writing anything back to the client. readDssHeader() explicitly sets the values of dssIsChainedWithSameID and dssIsChainedWithDiffID. Since the hang was caused by those two variables having values from the previous session when the first flush occurred, I don't see how it could happen on the server.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-06-26T01:37:30.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-26T01:37:30.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12344542/comment/12417696","id":"12417696","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Thanks!
