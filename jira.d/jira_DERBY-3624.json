I think the problem is that it only checks that the lock table contains two locks, and not that the two locks in fact are row locks on table A and table B. The locks could for example be locks on system tables held while one of the SELECT statements is compiled, in which case the other thread would mistakenly conclude that the other thread was done executing the SELECT statement, and it might go on and execute the INSERT statement too early to get a deadlock.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch [^barrier.diff] changes the wait logic so that it uses the Barrier class to make sure the other thread has executed far enough that it's safe to go on. It no longer checks the contents of the lock table. Instead, each thread will wait after executing the SELECT statement until the other thread has signaled that it too has completed the SELECT statement.\r\n\r\nI repeated Kathey's experiment with a long sleep at the beginning of t2.run(), and the test still passes with the new approach.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2014-08-19T08:49:13.524+0000","updated":"2014-08-19T08:49:13.524+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12394043/comment/14102043","id":"14102043","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"body":"Commit 1618821 from [~knutanders] in branch 'code/trunk'\r\n[ https://svn.apache.org/r1618821 ]\r\n\r\nDERBY-3624: Missing deadlock in storetests/st_derby715.java\r\n\r\nMake both tests wait until the other thread has executed the SELECT\r\nstatement and exhausted the ResultSet before they go on to the INSERT\r\nstatements that should deadlock.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"created":"2014-08-19T09:05:07.352+0000","updated":"2014-08-19T09:05:07.352+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12394043/comment/14133902","id":"14133902","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"This failure has not been seen again after the fix was checked in four weeks ago.
