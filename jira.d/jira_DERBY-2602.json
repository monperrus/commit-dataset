The header comment on that class indicates that it was created for the express purpose of allowing timestamps to have nanosecond precision.\r\n\r\nThe SQL Standard does not impose any limitation on the precision of timestamps, leaving the issue to the implementer. The relevant sections of the Standard are part 2, section 4.6 (Datetimes and intervals) and part 2, section 5.3 (<literal>).\r\n\r\nThe embedded driver supports the full range of timestamp values allowed by JDBC. In contrast, the network driver limits timestamps to microsecond precision. This truncation occurs both when timestamps pass from the client to the server and also in the reverse direction. I believe that that is the limit imposed by DB2; see http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dzichelp/v2r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db29.doc.intro/db2z_datetimetimestamp.htm The microsecond limit is also enforced by Derby's builtin TIMESTAMP() function; see the header comment for SQLTimestamp.parseDateOrTimestamp(), which notes that an exception is raised if the argument to TIMESTAMP() \"is incorrect for an IBM standard timestamp\".\r\n\r\nI believe that the network behavior should conform to the existing embedded behavior and that Derby's network layer should support the full range of timestamps allowed by JDBC. There are of course compatibility issues here. I propose the following solution:\r\n\r\no If both the client and the server are Derby code at 10.6 or higher, then timestamps should not be truncated.\r\n\r\no However, if either the client or the server is not Derby code at 10.6 or higher, then truncation should continue to occur.\r\n\r\nImplementation notes:\r\n\r\nThe truncation client->server happens in DateTime.timestampToTimestampBytes().\r\n   which is read by DRDAConnThread.readAndSetParams()\r\n\r\nThe truncation server->client happens in DRDAConnThread.writeFdocaVal()\r\n  which is read by DateTime.timestampBytesToTimestamp()","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2010-04-05T19:58:59.045+0000","updated":"2010-04-05T19:58:59.045+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12368487/comment/12856134","id":"12856134","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Attaching derby-2602-01-ad-dontTruncate.diff. This patch makes the client and server exchange full nanosecond-precision timestamps as happens in the embedded situation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the regression tests pass, this patch is not ready for commit. I would like to verify the compatibility of this patch with older clients.\r\n\r\nOnce this new behavior is committed, we may want to correct some metadata. For instance, the maximum column width for timestamps is 26 characters today. That is correct for timestamps which only have millisecond-precision, but for full nanosecond-precision, the column width should be 29 characters. However, I don't want to muddy this patch with that change because I suspect that it may affect a lot of test results.\r\n\r\nOne of the tricky bits about coding this patch was tracking down the relevant places in the code where the magic number 26 was used. I have replaced those magic numbers with a constant.
