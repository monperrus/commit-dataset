This is not the case before LUCENE-843.\r\n\r\nRight, when multiple documents are in flight at once (because multiple\r\nthreads are adding documents), the documents must be flushed in order\r\nof docID.  Each one grabs a unique (sequential) docID at the start\r\n(synchronized), does the indexing un-synchronized, then flushes\r\n(synchronized) but only if it is that documents \"turn\" to flush (ie it\r\nis the next docID to be written).  So if a large doc grabs docID\r\nfirst, then a small doc comes through, it's possible for small docs to\r\nfinish indexing before large doc does in which case small docs are\r\nbuffered, waiting for large doc to flush first.\r\n\r\n> I also slightly changed the exception semantics in IndexWriter:\r\n> previously if a disk full (or other) exception was hit when flushing\r\n> the buffered docs, the buffered deletes were retained but the\r\n> partially flushed buffered docs (if any) were discarded.\r\n\r\n> - Observation: Before LUCENE-843, both buffered docs and buffered\r\n>   deletes were retained when such an exception occurs.
