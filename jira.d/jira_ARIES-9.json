It turned out that the explanation why this weird behavior is observed is extremely simple. ServiceRecipe.register() behaves a little bit different if auto export is enabled. When auto export is disabled, service.create() is called inside blueprintContainer.registerService(). It is retrived from TriggerServiceFactory, which triggers internalGetService() to create the service. With auto export enabled it's a little bit different. internalGetService() is called much earlier and the service is also initialized earlier. If auto export is enabled retrieving interfaces to be used during the process of registration requires the service to be initialized, so that it could be analyzed using reflection. \r\n\r\nThis given issue is extremely easy to fix. We only need to ensure that the field that holds properties in the ServiceRecipe class is initialized before getClasses() is called. \r\n\r\nI'll attach a patch/diff created against the trunk (rev 946813). It contains a fix and a simple Pax Exam test that checks if this fix works. I used the already exisiting managers from the Blueprint sample project to test registration listeners that use auto export. However, I had to modify the registration listener that was used in this sample project, so that I can check if properties passed during registration are not null. \r\nI would prefer to create a testcase that would be completely separated from other Blueprint iTests. However, it seems that Aries uses a shared file with Blueprint definitions for all tests and nobody uses more dynamic aproaches to creating test bundles - i.e. bundles created during the test process using Tiny Bundles. I don't want to meddle :) - I used the same approach as the one that was already present in Aries.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n  Bartek ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bartosz","name":"bartosz","emailAddress":"Kowalewski dot Bartosz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bartosz Kowalewski","active":true},"created":"2010-05-20T23:25:52.713+0000","updated":"2010-05-20T23:25:52.713+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12436925/comment/12869806","id":"12869806","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bartosz","name":"bartosz","emailAddress":"Kowalewski dot Bartosz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bartosz Kowalewski","active":true},"body":"Attaching the diff","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bartosz","name":"bartosz","emailAddress":"Kowalewski dot Bartosz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bartosz Kowalewski","active":true},"created":"2010-05-20T23:27:13.635+0000","updated":"2010-05-20T23:27:13.635+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12436925/comment/12869843","id":"12869843","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gawor%40mcs.anl.gov","name":"gawor@mcs.anl.gov","emailAddress":"gawor at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jarek Gawor","active":true},"body":"I guess I forgot to commit a patch for this.
