Dyer","active":true},"body":"With this patch...\r\n\r\n- DIH attempts to reload the configuration every time a new import is started.  This is slightly more overhead, but negligible compared with the time an import takes as a whole.\r\n\r\n- The config is not loaded on startup and there is no need to have a <defaults /> section or have the config declared in solrconfig.xml at all.  Instead users have the option to specify the config file on the request with the \"config\" parameter.\r\n\r\n- The \"dataConfig\" parameter, which lets users include the entire configuration as a request parameter is now always supported (previously this was only supported in debug mode)\r\n\r\n-The \"reload-config\" command is still supported, which is useful for validating a new configuration file, or if you want to specify a file, load it, and not have it reloaded again on import. \r\n\r\n- Datasources can still be specified in solrconfig.xml.  As before these must be specified in the \"defaults\" section of the handler in solrconfig.xml.  However, these are not parsed until the main configuration is loaded.\r\n\r\n- If there is an xml mistake in the configuration a much more user-friendly message is given in xml format, not raw format as before.
