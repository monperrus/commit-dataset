However, for getXXX, the type given in the error message by the embedded driver not the target Java type (e.g. short in getShort), but the correspondig SQL type, i,e.. SMALLINT. I think this is the way it is because on the server, the same conversion methods are also used in CAST, where the target type is an SQL type, not a Java type. I chose to let the client use the same type strings as embedded does.
