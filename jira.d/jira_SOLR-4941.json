we pass that to the IndexWriterConfig's setUseCompoundFile method and log a warning instead of just ignoring it.\r\n\r\npatch also removes the warnings about the simple legacy <useCompoundFile> syntax since that actually makes sense now that it's a setting on IWC.\r\n\r\nI've also updated the tests to inspect the useCompoundFile on the IWC as well as checking the results of adding some segments.\r\n\r\nthere is still a failure in testTieredMergePolicyConfig where (as i understand it from talking to mike on IRC) the merged segment after the optimize command should *not* be in CFS format because of the noCFSRatio setting -- but the merged segment is still in CFS. i've attached the infostream log from running \"ant test -Dtestcase=TestMergePolicyConfig -Dtests.method=testTieredMergePolicyConfig\" to see if it helps illuminate the problem ... i suspect it's either a test bug because i still missunderstand something about how the MergePolicy settings come into play, or a genuine bug in the lower level TieredMP code -- i don't see how it could be specific to the solr config parsing logic since the IWC and TMP getters say they got the expected settings.\r\n\r\n(NOTE: the patch includes a nocommit in solrconfig-mergepolicy.xml to turn off the infostream before
