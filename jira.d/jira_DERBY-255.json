Previously, network server would always call getBlob/getClob for any lob related call. This change changes network server to use getBytes/getString and not  hold locks for any of the calls. \r\n\r\nThe implementation adds a new class EXTDTAInputStream to network server to localize the stream handling for large objects.   This should make it easier to adjust in the future as improvements are made in the large object handling. Because we need a length in order to write a stream, EXTDTAInputStream currently call getBytes or getString to get the length and stream out that object. This is apparently required because we cannot reset the input stream after traversing it to get the length.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture suggestions for changes to network server to handle this in a more complete way would be to:\r\n\r\n1) Change DDMWriter.writeScalarStream to  not require a length and optimize EXTDTAObjectInputStream accordingly\r\n\r\n2) Add support for lob locators with network server.  The getBlob, getClob calls would use the locators and would hold locks until the end of the transaction.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2005-05-30T06:06:42.000+0000","updated":"2005-05-30T06:06:42.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/32162/comment/66527","id":"66527","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Checked this in with revision 179014.  \r\n\r\nSending        java\\drda\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\drda\\DDMWriter.java\r\nSending        java\\drda\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\drda\\DRDAConnThread.java\r\nAdding         java\\drda\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\drda\\EXTDTAInputStream.java\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\master\\DerbyNet\\blobclob4BLOB.out\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\master\\DerbyNetClient\\blobclob4BLOB.out\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\master\\blobclob4BLOB.out\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\jdbcapi\\blobclob4BLOB.java\r\nTransmitting file data .......\r\nCommitted revision 179014.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2005-05-30T14:42:15.000+0000","updated":"2005-05-30T14:42:15.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/32162/comment/66842","id":"66842","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Checked in svn 179017 + 179198 to resolve this issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2005-06-02T18:30:07.000+0000","updated":"2005-06-02T18:30:07.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/32162/comment/66957","id":"66957","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Sunitha and I chatted on IRC about DERBY-255.
