It behaves the same way as before, but instead of dealing with an XML parse tree, a yaml parser is now created that associates a custom Java class (Config) with the entire config. In addition, keyspace and column family YAML entries are deserialized to new Keyspace and ColumnFamily instances, respectively.\r\n\r\nThis was implemented using SnakeYaml (http://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml/).\r\n\r\nThere are numerous benefits to this new approach: 1) a complete shifting away from an outdated, verbose data format 2) a cleaner, less bulky, human-readable config 3) significantly less code 4) simplicity of obtaining default values 5) trivial to update the keyspace and column family schemas\r\n\r\nAttached along with the patch are the replacement configurations for conf/cassandra.xml and test/conf/cassandra.xml, to emphasize the benefits of the transition, should the community approve of it.
