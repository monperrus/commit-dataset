I don't like that.\r\n\r\nalternatively we could have tokenstream explicitly set posIncrAtt to 0 in end() instead of clearAttributes()? I'm just wondering if thats any better really.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the patch is straightforward, with the exception of IW's built-in keywordtokenizer (StringField.java). that one is not actually setting end(), we were just relying upon dirty atts, so thats why i changed it.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2012-08-20T21:18:20.435+0000","updated":"2012-08-20T21:18:20.435+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545122/comment/13438227","id":"13438227","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"+1 to call a full clearAttributes().
