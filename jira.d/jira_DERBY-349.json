Pendleton","active":true},"body":"I have convinced myself that the original problem described by this bug is no longer present in the product, and there are just some test problems that need to be cleaned up. The test problems include:\r\n\r\n- The disabled tests for the client need to be turned back on. This is easy; I just need to delete the code that disabled those tests. One question is whether to delete all the no-longer-needed \"if (executeBatchTests)\" blocks, or just delete the little section at the head of the setXXX() method and leave the boolean executeBatchTests variable present, but always set to TRUE. I am leaning toward cleaning up all the dead code, even though it's a larger diff. \r\n- When the client gets a data conversion error in executeBatch, it wraps the actual exception in a BatchUpdateException. However, the judge_setXXX method in parameterMapping.java doesn't grok this, and so I need to enhance it to crawl through the exception chain looking for the actual data conversion exception of interest.\r\n- Then I need to carefully examine the new output, to ensure that it is safe to update the master file.\r\n- Lastly, unfortunately, there are a whole bunch of master files for this test. There are variations for different JVMs, different JDBC drivers, etc. Yuck. I think I'll have to crawl though a bunch of them. Unfortunately, I don't have access to all those JVMS and drivers, so I may need help from the community.\r\n\r\nStill, the bottom line is good news: when I'm done, we'll have more tests running, and easier-to-read result files.\r\n\r\nAnd one less open bug. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-04-02T02:30:27.000+0000","updated":"2006-04-02T02:30:27.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12311271/comment/12372805","id":"12372805","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Attached is 'derby-349-testFixes.diff', which is a patch proposal to resolve this issue. \r\n\r\nThe diff is a tad hard to read, so here are some notes. The proposed patch does the following:\r\n\r\n1) Adds a utility routine called 'checkForInvalidConversion' to parameterMapping.java. This routine knows how to hunt through a SQLException chain looking for the exception which indicates a data conversion error. I added this routine because I needed to change the 2 \"judge\" routines to teach them how to deal with a BatchUpdateException's underlying cause, and I didn't want to make the same change in 2 places, so I extracted the common code from the 2 \"judge\" routines into a shared routine and modified it there.\r\n\r\n2) Modifies parameterMapping.java so that the batch tests are always run. Formerly, the batch tests had some conditional logic in them allowing them to be skipped for certain data type combinations for the DerbyNetClient. That logic is no longer needed, since the DerbyNetClient now works.\r\n\r\n3) Updates the master output files for the JDK 1.4 and JDK 1.5 runs of parameterMapping.java under the DerbyNetClient framework.\r\n\r\nI did *not* update the JDK 1.6 master file, because I do not have a JDK 1.6 environment here. If somebody who has access to that environment could please:\r\na) Apply this patch\r\nb) Run java -Dframework=DerbyNetClient org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunTest jdbcapi/parameterMapping.java under 1.6\r\nc) Attach the parameterMapping.out that they get from their run to this issue\r\n\r\nthen I will inspect the parameterMapping.out diffs for JDK 1.6, ensure that they are reasonable, and re-post the diff with those changes.\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at this patch when you get a chance. It would be nice to re-enable these tests and resolve this JIRA issue.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-04-02T08:50:55.000+0000","updated":"2006-04-02T08:50:55.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12311271/comment/12372823","id":"12372823","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attaching patch (jdk16-master.diff) which updates the jdk16 master file.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-04-02T16:06:09.000+0000","updated":"2006-04-02T16:06:09.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12311271/comment/12372839","id":"12372839","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Thanks, Knut, that was fast!\r\n\r\nThe jdk1.6 results look great, and I've incorporated the masterfile update into the patch.\r\n\r\nDid you have any other comments or feedback on the patch?\r\n\r\nAs I looked at it again, I see now that the JDK1.4 and JDK 1.5 result files are identical, so I don't think this test needs a separate jdk1.4 result file.
