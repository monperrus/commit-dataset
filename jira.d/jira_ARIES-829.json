Then I spotted the context. It does this:\r\n\r\n\r\n                Bundle bundle = ref.getBundle();\r\n                if (bundle != null) {\r\n                    BundleContext ctx = bundle.getBundleContext();\r\n                    if (ctx != null) {\r\n                          ctx.ungetService(ref);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\nThis means we are using the bundle context of the bundle that registered the service to unget it. The code where we do a lookup says this:\r\n\r\ngetBundleContextForServiceLookup().getService(reference);\r\n\r\nwhich returns in the general case the BundleContext for the BlueprintContainer. So we get using the bundle context of the blueprint bundle that uses the service, and unget using the bundle context of the bundle providing the service. I know I'm having a bad day but my eyes sprung out on stalks when I saw this.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"166191","summary":"ReferenceListRecepie releases using the wrong BundleContext","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=not","name":"not","emailAddress":"not at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384"},"displayName":"Alasdair Nottingham","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=not","name":"not","emailAddress":"not at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384"},"displayName":"Alasdair Nottingham","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":0,"total":0,"comments":[]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ARIES-829/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0st3j:"}}
