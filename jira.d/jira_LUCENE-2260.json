The classes referenced can never be unloaded therefore, which would be fine if all live in the same classloader. As soon as the Attribute or implementation class or the subclass of the deprecated API are loaded by a different classloder (e.g. Lucene lives in bootclasspath of tomcat, but lucene-consumer with custom attributes lives in a webapp), they can never be unloaded, because a reference exists.\r\n\r\nLibs like CGLIB or JavaAssist or JDK's reflect.Proxy have a similar cache for generated class files. They also manage this by a WeakHashMap.
