Hmm, I don't think we should do that.\r\n\r\nIt costs nothing, as the standard vInt will be read only some 1 or 2 bytes, if you really read until the last byte, you have so big vInts that it might even be better not to use vInts at all.- And: The not-unrolled loops do the check always.\r\n\r\nbq.

Otherwise you can even produce endless loops at some places. - Of course not when you have tight loops, but things like checking that the document count is in line with e.g. some other value from liveDocs is essential. I will open an issue for that, the older Lucene formats are much besster secured, but trunk is horrible, just because some people here seem to want to prevent any check, which is also a security issue when you e.g. download indexes through network connections and a man in the middle modifies the stream.

The unrolled code also has a bug, that it handles negative longs wrong, but that should be prevented (in my opinion also for ints).\r\n\r\nThe current assert for both long and int is completely harmless, as it will only be executed, if the vInt/vLong has the maximum number of bytes, which is very unlikely.

The original while loop then simply proceeds with reading bytes util the highest bit is null.

And in the case of the last byte read (where the current assert is), throw exception. If we don't unroll all readVInts we have to somehow also make the loop exit after too many bytes are read, which would be an costly extra check in the loop - thats the reason why I want to unroll all loops to fail after 5 or 9 bytes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-03-17T14:08:53.608+0000","updated":"2012-03-17T14:10:29.933+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12540553/comment/13232272","id":"13232272","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"bq.
