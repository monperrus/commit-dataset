But it does:\r\n - unlock the lock in a finally block\r\n - fix thread visibility of the lock by making it volatile\r\n - change the lock in each runner to be a countdown latch since the only purpose appears to be to wait for the runner to stop.  This fixes a race condition where previously the lock/unlock pair in blockUntilFinished() could possibly execute *before* the runner itself locks the lock.\r\n\r\nThere are other race conditions and thread safety problems I see, but I'm not sure if any are serious or not.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2009-11-06T00:57:27.527+0000","updated":"2009-11-06T00:57:27.527+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439989/comment/12774172","id":"12774172","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"OK, I'm able to reproduce the problem with the test code in the referenced thread... looking into why.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2009-11-06T01:23:49.038+0000","updated":"2009-11-06T01:23:49.038+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439989/comment/12774179","id":"12774179","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"Found it.\r\n\r\nAll of the threads check \"lock\" and block on it.\r\nWhen the lock unlocks, one thread locks it again, gets through, but never unlocks it because the lock instance var as been nulled.
