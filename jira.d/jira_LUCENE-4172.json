What's wrong with?:  import <package>.*; – especially when there are many classes?\r\n\r\nSome reasons given here: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/147454/why-is-using-a-wild-card-with-a-java-import-statement-bad]: namespace polution; package additions can trigger compilation failure; compilation is slower.\r\n\r\nMy IDE (IntelliJ) automatically folds imports, so assuming most devs have a similar experience, many classes in a package don't cause actual clutter.\r\n\r\nbq. And is there a coding standard that Lucene/Solr adheres to? I am unaware.\r\n\r\nThe only standard I've seen referred to is \"Sun's Java style rules, with the exception of 2 spaces per indent level instead of 4\".","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2012-06-29T06:50:23.401+0000","updated":"2012-06-29T06:50:23.401+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12596183/comment/13403806","id":"13403806","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"I prefer the individual imports, not wildcards.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2012-06-29T09:50:46.465+0000","updated":"2012-06-29T09:50:46.465+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-4172/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04fxr:"}}
