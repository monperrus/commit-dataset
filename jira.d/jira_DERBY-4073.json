In the case of SSL, this will be \"Ssl\" with value \"off\". When the application is trying to call setSsl(\"off\") through reflection it may invoke setSsl(int) instead of setSsl(String), failing because \"off\" cannot be converted to an integer. In some implementations both methods will be invoked.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to look at this, and I don't know which one is correct:\r\n  o the reflection code of the third-party applications using Derby isn't written well enough.\r\n  o Derby is to blame for the problem by providing two setSsl-methods.\r\n\r\nI don't know if providing overloading setters violates the JavaBean spec, or any other relevant spec we should follow.\r\n\r\nThe easiest technical solution is to rename one of the methods or possibly making one of them private. Both of these will break existing applications using that method to configure a Derby client data source.\r\nIs doing this, and providing a release note, sufficient?\r\nDoes anyone see any other solutions?\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that in some applications, it is impossible to configure ClientConnectionPoolDataSource or ClientXADataSource to use SSL. The reasons are the problem described here and DERBY-4067. One typical class of software with this problem is application servers. A workaround is to avoid setting the SSL property, which isn't doable if you need SSL of course...\r\n\r\nA related issue is whether it should be allowed to set the SSL property both through the setter method(s) and as a connection attribute.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"38729","summary":"Creation/configuration of ClientXDataSource fails because of two setSsl methods","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310090":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10101","value":"Release Note Needed","id":"10101"}],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12310050":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":14,"total":14,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12415660/comment/12677051","id":"12677051","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Hi Kristian,\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert on Java Beans. It may be that the calling application falls back on ordinary introspection to find the bean methods. There could be a bug in the the application or in the Introspector class provided with the JRE. It may be possible to hide the setSsl(int) method by providing BeanInfo classes in our public api packages. E.g., a ClientDataSource40BeanInfo class which just exposes the getters and setters we really want to publish. There is some explanation of this pattern in the BeanInfo javadoc and here: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/javabeans/introspection/index.html This may be an annoying amount of work which still doesn't fix the problem.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the Introspector or the calling application ought to be smart enough to look for the setSsl() overload which matches the return type of getSsl().
