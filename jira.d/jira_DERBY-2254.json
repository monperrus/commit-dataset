Derby was configured with a 18 GB database buffer. The\r\ncrash occured about 2 hours after re-starting an existing\r\ndatabase. The load consisted of 64 clients running transactions\r\nback-to-back. Since the database was \"just\" started most of the\r\ntransactions had to read data from the disk, thus there were about 60\r\nconcurrent read requests for getting data into the database buffer. At\r\nthe same time the single back-ground thread was having a hard time to\r\nkeep up writing out dirty data to the disk. At this time there were\r\nplenty of free room in the page cache so no data blocks were \"evicted\"\r\nout to disk by the user threads.\r\n\r\nSince the background thread were not able to flush data pages fast\r\nenough it was also unable to reclaim log files. So the amount of log\r\nkept growing. \r\n\r\nOne thing I do not understand is that most of the log files have their\r\nnormal size while some are very close to the max log file size.

I don't think we have ever even had a machine with more than 2GB of memory.  18gb is definitely going to stress the system.  \r\n\r\nHere the issues I think you are running into, it may be better to get them into separate issues for tracking:\r\n1) my best guess is that the act of switching the log file at 1 gig has become stuck behind finishing the checkpoint.  I don't \r\n     believe there is a design issue that we have to wait for checkpoint to switch.  My first guess is that out single background\r\n     daemon is stuck doing  a checkpoint and can't service the switch request - but I have not checked the code.   For these\r\n     multi-processor systems a single daemon not doing anything async is probably not going to cut it.\r\n2) The math for largest file number looks like it has a bug somewhere.  I don't think we ever really expected a file to grow to\r\n      this size, mostly it was there to make sure someone didn't set the log file size to greater than it.   A test should be written\r\n      and the code fixed to properly handle forcing a switch, or waiting for a switch if you get to this size.   My guess is this has\r\n      not been tested before.

It is impossible to know what kind of \r\ncorruption might have happened but all the following are possible, because derby rely's on the info in the log file to maintain\r\nconsistent data.  Because of in memory database caching the database files on disk may be severely out of date/inconsistent without proper recovery processing using the log files.  All the following corruptions are possible when one deletes one or more\r\nlog files:\r\ntransaction inconsistent data between tables - many of these inconsistencies can't be determined by derby\r\ninconsistent data between base tables and indexes - running the consistency checker does a good job of checking for this\r\ninconsistent data in long rows - a long row may stretch across many pages and the links depend on tranactional consistency if this\r\n     is broken a number of runtime errors may occur\r\ninconsistent data in long columns - similar to long row a single column may be linked across many pages and this consistency is\r\n    maintained by the transaction log.\r\n\r\nIf it is ever necessary to remove the log because of some derby bug the only safe thing to do is to go back to your more recent \r\nbackup.  If you don't have one, what I usually tell users is to assume the db they are accessing is corrupt but accessible.  The only\r\nsafe thing at that point is to data mine the existing db to copy whatever data looks good out to a file and then load it into a newly\r\ncreated db.

After applying this patch, I can't reproduce the bug using the attached repro. I have run the repro for more than 1500 iterations.\r\n\r\nThis is my understanding of what is going on here:\r\n\r\nA) The original assertion is supposed to check that you are not creating an illegal log instant. A log instant consists of a log file number and an offset into that file. A log instant is illegal if the file number or offset are too big. In this particular case, the assertion fails because the offset is too big.\r\n\r\nB) The offset is the actual end of the current log file. That is, the log file has already spilled past its legal end.\r\n\r\nC) The assertion is triggered after the log writer notices that the log file needs to be switched. The log writer ought to detect this condition and switch the log file BEFORE writing a log record which spills over the end. Unfortunately, the log writer only notices this condition AFTER a log record has been written which straddles the legal end of file.\r\n\r\nD) We check for whether we should switch by asking whether the remaining bytes we need to write will spill past the legal end of the file. To compute the number of bytes we expect to write, we add the length of the log wrapper overhead to the length of the current log record. However, it turns out that may need to write more bytes than that. The calculation does not include an extra four bytes needed to write a terminating 0 to the log. The calculation also does not include the bytes needed to write a checksum record.\r\n\r\nE) If we are already very close to the legal end of the log file, then we could spill past the end after writing the wrapper, the log record, the terminating 0, and the checksum record. I suppose that we get here if the checkpointing thread can't get in often enough to switch log files before we encroach on the end of the current file.\r\n\r\nF) The fix is to require that the log accomodate that extra overhead (the terminating 0 and the checksum record). Now we force a log switch if there is not enough room to write the current log record, its wrapper, the terminating 0, and the checksum record.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have made 3 changes:\r\n\r\n1) The actual change to LogToFile to increase the size of the overhead space we require to avoid a log switch.\r\n\r\n2) All of the places in LogToFile which update the remembered endPostion have been reworked to call a brief method which sanity checks whether we have spilled past the end of the file already. I put in this instrumentation in order to find where the extra bytes were being written. I think it is a useful sanity check but I can remove it if people think that it will slow down log processing significantly.\r\n\r\n3) I added a little more information to the original assertion and its friends in LogCounter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTouches the following files:\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/log/LogAccessFile.java\r\n\r\nExposed the length of the checksum record so that LogToFile can accurately calculate its overhead.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/log/LogCounter.java\r\n\r\nItems (1) and (2) as described above.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/log/LogToFile.java\r\n\r\nItem (3) above.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2011-05-11T13:22:55.843+0000","updated":"2011-05-11T13:22:55.843+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12360809/comment/13031875","id":"13031875","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
