A PrefixTreeStrategy can index all shapes, not just points, so it can't be sure if IsWithin is supported.  It seemed simple enough to remove support for it but in order to make the tests pass I had to change various test references to \"IsWithin\" and make it Intersects, like renaming cities-IsWithin-BBox.txt to use Intersects in its name and content.  Perhaps it wouldn't be too much of a hack for this strategy to have a pointOnly boolean which has the side-effect of making IsWithin synonymous with Intersects?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2012-09-12T03:19:56.206+0000","updated":"2012-09-12T03:19:56.206+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12607128/comment/13453674","id":"13453674","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmale","name":"cmale","emailAddress":"gento0nz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Male","active":true},"body":"In the future, once we remove much of the restrictions on the SpatialStrategy interface, we could have implementations of PTS that was limited to Points and supported isWithin.
