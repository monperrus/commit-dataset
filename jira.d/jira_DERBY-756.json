The good news is that we get to about 81,000 iterations. The bad news is that we still run out of memory. I changed the query from a count(distinct id) to a simple count(*) and the OutOfMemory error was thrown after about 81-82K executes. I think there is another memory leak (or two) in our system that we need to identify and fix. Is it safe to mark this bug closed and file another bug to track that issue or should I use this bug to track the memory leak that remains.\r\n\r\nIf I don't hear from anyone, I'll mark this bug closed and file another one.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mkhettry","name":"mkhettry","emailAddress":"manish_khettry at yahoo dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Manish Khettry","active":true},"created":"2006-01-25T12:17:50.000+0000","updated":"2006-01-25T12:17:50.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12326675/comment/12363928","id":"12363928","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bandaram","name":"bandaram","emailAddress":"bandaram at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Satheesh Bandaram","active":true},"body":"My suggestion is to create a sub-task of this bug, to cover any other memory leak, if present.
