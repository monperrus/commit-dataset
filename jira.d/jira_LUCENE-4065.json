are totally valid natural usecases for false, where you don't want gaps because you want phrasequeries to act as if the word was never actually there.\r\n\r\nBut 'not inserting gaps' is separate from proper propagation of existing gaps.\r\n\r\nSo I think we should provide an option (either fix 'false' or make it an enum), where you still get a legit tokenstream and dont totally screw it up, but
