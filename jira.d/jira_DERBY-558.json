I expect that setting \"noTimeout\" to true might cause the query to run more slowly (since it has to evaluate ALL possible join orders for all of the tables in question), but it should _not_ cause the optimizer to hang forever.\n\nI noticed that \"subquery flattening\" is peformed on the query, which introduces dependencies between the various tables and thus restricts the possible join orders that the optimizer can choose (see http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.1/tuning/ctuntransform25868.html).
