I confirmed that the patch applies and builds, and I ran the new test cases with and without the code changes--as expected, they fail without the fix and pass with it.\r\n\r\nI do have two questions/comments about the patch.  I don't think either of these is worthy of blocking the patch, but I'm nonetheless curious...\r\n\r\n1)  FromBaseTable.java:\r\n\r\nThere are two places where uses of \"tableName\" have been replaced with\r\ncalls to getOrigTableName():\r\n\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t(correlationName != null) ? correlationName : tableName.getTableName(), \r\n+\t\t\t\t\t(correlationName != null) ? correlationName : getOrigTableName().getTableName(), \r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n-\t\t\treturn tableName.getFullTableName();\r\n+\t\t\treturn getOrigTableName().getFullTableName();\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n-\t\treturn getResultColumnsForList(allTableName, resultColumns, tableName);\r\n+\t\treturn getResultColumnsForList(allTableName, resultColumns, \r\n+\t\t\t\tgetOrigTableName());\r\n\r\nBut all other occurrences of \"tableName\" are left as they are.  Can you perhaps explain the distinction between when one should be used over the other?  Or put another way, can you explain why these three--and only these three--occurrences were changed but the rest were left alone?  If possible, I think it'd be good to add comments--perhaps as part of the javadoc for the new \"getOrigTableName()\" method?--explaining when that method should be used (as opposed to just using the tableName field).  That might help developers down the road avoid using the method incorrectly.  The other option is to simply add comments to the places where you used \"getOrigTableName()--you could perhaps just use what you wrote in your previous comment for this Jira, which I think gives a good enough explanation...\r\n\r\n2)  DMLModStatementNode.java:\r\n\r\nIn the following code:\r\n\r\n+\t\t\tResultColumn column = (ResultColumn) rcl.elementAt( i );\r\n+\t\t\tColumnReference\treference = column.getReference();\r\n+\t\t\tString crTableName = reference.getTableName();\r\n+\r\n+\t\t\tif ( reference != null && crTableName != null)\r\n+\t\t\t{\r\n\r\nThere's a check to see if \"reference\" is null, but that check happens AFTER \"reference\" is used.  This seems to suggest to me that either 1) reference can never be null, in which case there's no need to check for it, or 2) reference CAN be null but there aren't any test cases for such a situation.  Do you know which of these is true?  I *think* it's the former--i.e.that in case of updates or inserts, the result column will be for the target base table and thus cannot have a reference that is null...but can you confirm this?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2006-09-15T20:56:23.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-15T20:56:23.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348939/comment/12435146","id":"12435146","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"I plan to work on committing this change.

Responses to your questions/comments:\r\n\r\n1)  One would use getOrigTableName() for qualifying column names at bind phase only ( if the column name is qualified by the user)  There are alot of code in the compiler layer and I have spent quite some time to determine where the fix should go with minimal code impact.  I only applied the additonal logic at areas where the binding logic uses \"exposedName\" and it makes perfect sense to place the logic here since\r\nthe correlation name are handled in a similar manner.  Once the underlying table descriptor is determined and bound, the table name can be just thought of an alias to the table descriptor.  For other methods that still use the tableName member field, I left them AS IS because there are many places in the code that relies on its name to find the actual table descriptor, so changing those methods will certainly break the system.  If synonym is not involved, getOrigTableName() will return tableName anyway; thus, limiting the impact on the compiler subsystem.  I think it is a good idea to put additional comments to getOrigTableName(), I'll submit another follow up patch for that.\r\n\r\n2)  Good catch, it looks like a refactor error on my part, I meant to do this:\r\n\r\nif ( reference != null && reference.getTableName() != null)\r\n\r\nI'll fix this also and resubmit the patch.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"created":"2006-09-15T23:43:42.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-15T23:43:42.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348939/comment/12435157","id":"12435157","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"body":"Attaching derby1784-trunk-diff03b.txt to address Army's comments and suggestions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"created":"2006-09-16T00:04:26.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-16T00:04:26.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348939/comment/12435522","id":"12435522","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"I ran full set of successful tests against ibm 1.4.2.

If the merge to 10.1 is not clean may need help from the contributer.\r\n\r\nm1_ibm142:91>svn commit\r\n\r\nSending        java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\DMLModStatementNode.java\r\nSending        java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\FromBaseTable.java\r\nSending        java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\FromTable.java\r\nSending        java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\InsertNode.java\r\nSending        java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\UpdateNode.java\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\master\\synonym.out\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\suites\\derbylang.runall\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\lang\\synonym.sql\r\nTransmitting file data ........\r\nCommitted revision 447469.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2006-09-18T16:55:12.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-18T16:55:12.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348939/comment/12435530","id":"12435530","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"meant to include in last comment that my commit to trunk was based on the derby1784-trunk-stat03b.txt patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2006-09-18T17:01:02.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-18T17:01:02.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348939/comment/12435607","id":"12435607","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"body":"Attaching 10.1 backport patch derby1784-10.1-diff01.txt.  derbylang passes successfully.
