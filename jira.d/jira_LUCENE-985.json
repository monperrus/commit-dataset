overhead of each separate String).  So, every time a new term is\r\nseen, it puts it at the end of the current block; when there's not\r\nenough space it allocates another block from the pool.  So a given\r\nterm must fit entirely into a single block.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2007-08-18T00:16:20.785+0000","updated":"2007-08-18T00:16:20.785+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12376270/comment/12520741","id":"12520741","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=karl.wettin","name":"karl.wettin","emailAddress":"karl dot wettin at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karl Wettin","active":true},"body":"I doubt anyone will have a problem with the limit.
