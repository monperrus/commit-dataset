How can AttributeSource be final?\r\n\r\nThis was just a comment about the class, but its not possible because it is extended by TokenStreams or similar classes - but the implementation of methods should not be alterable. So *all* methods should be final, at least all methods that access/modify the private maps.\r\n\r\nA correct plan for \"own implementations of AttributeSource\" would be to create an abstract AttributeSource base class that defines the behaviour and all impls in the current AttributeSource are final.
