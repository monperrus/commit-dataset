Explicitly upgrading the index format might be a good idea, and might make hte index more performant, but as I understood it, the way things had been implemented with codecs explicitly upgrading the index format wasn't strictly neccessary, and that users should be able to upgrade their lucene apps same way that was supported with other index format upgrades in the past: the old index can be read, and as changes are made new segments will be re-written in the new format.  (Note in\r\nparticular: at the moment we don't mention IndexUpgrader in MIGRATE.txt at all.)\r\n\r\nIt appears however, based on this stack trace and some other experiements i tried, that any attempts to \"delete\" documents in a segment that is using the Lucene3xCodec will fail.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a really scary time bomb sitaution, because if you upgrade, things will seem to be working -- you can even add documents, and depending on the order that you do things, some \"old\" segments may get merged and use the new format, so *some* deletes of \"old\" documents (in those merged/upgraded) segments may work, but then somewhere down the road, you may try to a delete that affects docs in a still un-merge/upgraded segment, and that delete will fail -- 5 minutes later, if another merge has happened, attempting to do the exact same delete may succeed.\r\n\r\nAll of which begs the question: is this a known/intended limitation of the Lucene3xCodec, or an oversight in the Lucene3xCodec?\r\n\r\nif it's expected, then it seems like we should definitely spell out this limitation in MIGRATE.txt and advocate either full rebuilds, or the use of IndexUpgrader for anyone who's indexes are non-static.\r\n\r\nOn the Solr side of things, i think we should even want to consider automaticly running IndexUpgrader on startup if we detect that the Lucene3xCodec is in use to simplify things -- we can't even suggest running \"optimize\" as a quick/easy way to force and index format upgrade because if the 3x index as already optimized then it's a no-op and the index stays in the 3x format.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nRobert said, that this is a wanted limitation (in fact its explicitely added to the code, without that UOE it \"simply works\"), but I disagree here and lots of other people:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nIn the early days (I mean in the time when it was already read only until we refactored the IndexReader.delete()/Codec stuff), this was working, because the LiveDocs were always handled in a special way. Making it now 100% read-only is in my opinion very bad, as it does not allow to update documents in a 3.x index anymore, so you have no chance, you must run IndexUpgrader. \r\n\r\nThe usual step like opening old Index and adding documents works (because the new documents are added always to new segment), but the much more usual IW.updateDocument() which is commonly used also to add documents fails on old Indexes. This is a no-go, we have to fix this. If we allow the trick with updating LiveDocs on 3.x codec, for the end-user the \"read-only\" stuff in Lucene3x codec would be completely invisible, as he can do everything IndexWriter provides. The other horrible things like changing norms is no longer possible, so deletes are the only thing that affects here. The read-only ness of Lucene3x codec would only be visible to the user when someone tries to explicitly create an index with Lucene3x codec. And I understood the CHANGES/MIGRATE.txt exactly as that.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nOn the list, Robert added a simple patch, reverting the UOE in Lucene3xCodec, so the LiveDocs format is RW again.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"23685","summary":"Allow

So we can easily write a 4.x commit, \r\nand at the same time preserve the 3.x per-segment metadata.\r\n\r\nSo this was no cleanup commit!\r\n\r\nAnd again thats why I am against changing the backwards policy, because if we had enforced this earlier we would have likely never been able to \r\niterate to this point: it would have presented a massive roadblock.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2012-08-29T15:34:42.919+0000","updated":"2012-08-29T15:34:42.919+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605345/comment/13444179","id":"13444179","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"I can commit this to 4.x once Mike has had a chance to look/think about it too.\r\n\r\nJust again to reiterate, this was not done for cleanup or silly reasons, but good reasons.\r\n\r\nBut I don't imagine us refactoring the codec API or index structure for 4.x in any way that\r\nwould be made more difficult by this patch: I just want all possibilities left on the table\r\nfor the next major release.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2012-08-29T16:37:27.776+0000","updated":"2012-08-29T16:37:27.776+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605345/comment/13444328","id":"13444328","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"+1 to separate what we do for 4.0 vs a change to our back-compat policy.

It seems like (I have to think about the patch) doing this for 4.0 is easy ... but that may not necessarily hold true for future releases.\r\n\r\nAgreed -- if we want to say that 5.0 can \"read\" 4.0 but can't delete docs that's fine, but let's worry about that when a situation where it actually makes a difference in performance/simplicity/maintainability comes up.  Hell, if it really makes a big difference, i'm fine with saying that you *must* run an upgrade tool for 5.0 to even read 4.0, but we should't make those decisions in the abstract, they should be based on actual implications.\r\n\r\nbq. the fact that no users have complained (until now) about 4.0 disallowing deletions on a 3.x index is telling.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think people are reading too much into this - i suspect most of the people who have been using the alpha and beta so far are the more \"adventurous\" devs, who are more likely to \"rebuild the world\" on upgrade anyway.  More \"cautious\" and \"conservative\" devs who will want to upgrade in place are probably not that interested in looking at 4.0 until 4.0-final.\r\n\r\nBottom line: If we have a simple patch that will allow 4.0 to not only \"read\" 3.x indexes, but also easily \"update\" those indexes via delets/merges, then i say we commit it.\r\n\r\nIf enough folks feel strongly that this patch shouldn't be committed, and that IndexUpgrader should be used by any user who might want to \"delete\" docs from a 3x index, then I would argue that we not only need to more heavily document this, but we should also find some way to make the 4.0 IndexWriter \"fail fast\" when you point it at an index that contains segments using the 3x codec - we should not allow this time bomb situation where some doc updates/deletes might work because the segments have already been merged/upgraded to the 4x format, but other updates/deletes fail because the affected documents are still in a 3x segment.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2012-08-29T19:28:36.681+0000","updated":"2012-08-29T19:28:36.681+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605345/comment/13444350","id":"13444350","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"I don't think that users complaining or not should affect our back-compat policy.
