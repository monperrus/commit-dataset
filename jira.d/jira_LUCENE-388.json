it looks like the entire segment list is walked looking to see of\r\nenough docs (minMergeDocs) can be collected together to do a merge.  With a\r\nlarge minMergeDocs, this can get expensive.  Perhaps a count should be kept of\r\nthe number of docs in memory, and when it exceeds minMergeDocs, then call the\r\nmerge logic.\r\n\r\nOf course keeping track of the count would require modifications to many\r\nIndexWriter methods. It looks like the performance gains may well be worth it\r\nthough.\r\n\r\nBTW, I don't think a mergefactor of 1000 is typical (way too many\r\nfiledescriptors in use, and a big hit to searchers).  A high minMergeDocs (now\r\nmaxBufferedDocs) *is* typical and useful though.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2005-05-17T01:11:27.000+0000","updated":"2005-05-17T01:11:27.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12314538/comment/12322377","id":"12322377","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting%40apache.org","name":"cutting@apache.org","emailAddress":"?","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10453"},"displayName":"cutting@apache.org","active":false},"body":"Your benchmark might run faster if you set maxBufferedDocs smaller.

When an index is being incrementally or batch updated, IndexWriter\r\nprobably does need to scan the Segments to see if they need merging to obey the\r\nconfiguration settings.  However a fresh index is a special case, and seems like\r\nit could be optimized (this may be what you meant by 'small docs' ?).  \r\n\r\nIn really large scale indexes/indices(?) the number of documents being\r\nincrementally/batch updated is going to be totally minor compared to the cost of\r\nbuilding the full index for the first time.  For a true High Availability\r\nsolution, one will always need to factor in the cost to rebuild the index from\r\nscratch should it come to that.  Making the initial index as fast as possible\r\ngives much smaller down time.  \r\n\r\nFor crawling applications that use Lucene, this optimization will probably not\r\neven get noticed, because of the latency in retrieving the source material to\r\nmake up the document.  Only when the source material can be accessed fast will\r\nthis optimization be important.\r\n\r\nRemoving this CPU bottleneck has even more benefits when you consider those\r\nsolutions using Lucene to parallel index documents.  This optimization means\r\nthat you get a multiplication of benefit the more CPU's being utilized,\r\nparticularly if the architecture is a producer/consumer operation with a Buffer\r\nin between. (obviously IO starts to get in the way more).  With an optimization\r\nthe CPU can be better utilized performing tokenization etc.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nPaul","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=psmith%40apache.org","name":"psmith@apache.org","emailAddress":"tallpsmith at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Smith","active":true},"created":"2005-05-17T07:53:10.000+0000","updated":"2005-05-17T07:53:10.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12314538/comment/12322379","id":"12322379","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=psmith%40apache.org","name":"psmith@apache.org","emailAddress":"tallpsmith at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Smith","active":true},"body":"Doug, after more testing, you are correct that tweaking the maxBuffered from\r\n10,000 to 5000 gives slightly better performance.\r\n\r\nHowever I believe this is because with maxBufferedDocs==5000, this loop counter\r\nis reset more frequently, and so suffers less of the CPU drain.  \r\n\r\nI ran more tests using the hacked version using both 5000 and 10000, and the\r\nhacked version still runs better.

See any VM implementation performance papers such as in the IBM Systems journal some years \r\nago, and others. \r\n\r\nNo idea why the javacc folks didn't come up with an API that does not involve exceptions for *normal* \r\ncontrol flow. Well, javacc has probably been unmaintained dead code for some time now. [Even Xerces \r\nhas such gotchas deep inside it's low level native API - I chatted with this some time ago with a Sun \r\nengineer].\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can preallocate the IOException in FastCharStream in  a private static final var, and then \r\nthrow the same exception object again and again on EOS. That gives some factor 2x the cheap way \r\nbecause the stack trace does not have to be generated and filled repeatadly (Same for the QueryParser \r\ncopy of FastCharStream).\r\n\r\nThe other additional 5x comes from getting rid of the exception completely - catching exceptions is \r\nexpensive. This is done via dirty patching the javacc generated code to not require EOS exceptions at \r\nall. Instead you can return 0xFFFF as an EOS marker, or some other unused Unicode value. Look at the \r\njavacc generated code and see where it catches the EOS exception. That's where you'd need to fiddle \r\naround, making sure true abnormal exceptions are still handled properly. It's really an akward \r\nmaintainance nightmare because it interferes with generated code, so I don't really recommend this. \r\n\r\nStill, StandardAnalyzer eats CPU (and buffer memory) like there's no tomorrow. Instead, I'd recommend \r\ngiving PatternAnalyzer (from the \"memory\" SVN contrib area) a try. The functionality is almost the same \r\nas StandardAnalyzer, but it can be many times faster, especially when using it with a String rather than \r\na Reader, and you don't have to wait indefinitely for lucene to get fixed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=whoschek%40lbl.gov","name":"whoschek@lbl.gov","emailAddress":"whoschek at lbl dot gov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"hoschek","active":true},"created":"2005-05-25T13:40:54.000+0000","updated":"2005-05-25T13:40:54.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12314538/comment/12427743","id":"12427743","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=otis","name":"otis","emailAddress":"otis at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=otis&avatarId=15859","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=otis&avatarId=15859","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=otis&avatarId=15859","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=otis&avatarId=15859"},"displayName":"Otis Gospodnetic","active":true},"body":"This last patch looks good to me, and I remember looking at this issue when Paul brought it up.
