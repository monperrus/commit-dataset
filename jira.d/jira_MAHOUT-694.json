With the latest version of Lucene, ExtractReuters it appends -tmp on to the directory name, hence the message \r\n\r\n{{Deleting all files in ./examples/bin/work/reuters-out/-tmp}}\r\n\r\nThe next step in build-reuters.sh is to run seqdirectory on ./examples/bin/work/reuters-out, which ends up producing an empty sequence file. You can confirm this by doing:\r\n\r\n{{./bin/mahout seqdumper -s examples/bin/work/reuters-out-seqdir/chunk-0}}\r\n\r\nThe result should indicate that this file is empty. The problem isn't caught until the k-means clusterer tries to grab random vectors out of the sequence files generated by seq2sparse, which of course is also empty.\r\n\r\nTo workaround, try:\r\n\r\n{{mv ./examples/bin/work/reuters-out/-tmp/* ./examples/bin/work/reuters-out/ && rmdir ./examples/bin/work/reuters-out/-tmp}}\r\n\r\nAnd re-run build-reuters.sh - it should work this time around.\r\n\r\nThis didn't fail for me initially because I still had a ./examples/bin/work/reuters-out directory containing the dataset around from a previous run.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, instead of editing your original message, just post the additional details in a follow-up comment. The way JIRA works, it is much easier to track the status of the ticket that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drew.farris","name":"drew.farris","emailAddress":"drew dot farris at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822"},"displayName":"Drew Farris","active":true},"created":"2011-05-19T01:48:09.709+0000","updated":"2011-05-19T01:48:09.709+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507000/comment/13035932","id":"13035932","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drew.farris","name":"drew.farris","emailAddress":"drew dot farris at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822"},"displayName":"Drew Farris","active":true},"body":"Actually, it appears that you will also need to to run the following command after the {{mv}} before re-running {{build-reuters.sh}}\r\n\r\n{{./bin/mahout seqdirectory \\}}\r\n{{  -i ./examples/bin/work/reuters-out/ \\}}\r\n{{  -o ./examples/bin/work/reuters-out-seqdir \\}}\r\n{{  -c UTF-8 -chunk 5}}\r\n\r\nI'm testing a patch to fix build-reuters.sh to account for the new behavior ExtractReuters","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drew.farris","name":"drew.farris","emailAddress":"drew dot farris at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822"},"displayName":"Drew Farris","active":true},"created":"2011-05-19T02:00:19.615+0000","updated":"2011-05-19T02:01:25.322+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507000/comment/13035948","id":"13035948","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drew.farris","name":"drew.farris","emailAddress":"drew dot farris at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=drew.farris&avatarId=16822"},"displayName":"Drew Farris","active":true},"body":"Hmm, that's not working either.
