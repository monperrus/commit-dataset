With patch1, we do not commit any other statements which could be executed in the meantime. But with patch2, client driver will commit everything executed before the call to setTransactionIsolation. This, I think is not expected when we have explicitly set the connection's auto-commit to false. \r\n\r\nI am attaching a modified repro 'd638_repro2.java' which executes some statements after setting auto-commit to false and before the call to setTransactionIsolation.
