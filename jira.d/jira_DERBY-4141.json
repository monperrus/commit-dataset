See attached preliminary patch (derby-4141_embedded_diff1.txt), but looking at the client code in NetXAResource it seems for any SQLException we use errorCode XAER_RMERR.  I am not sure how to determine if it is a session ending exception on client. Does anyone know how to do this?\r\n\r\nAlso, I need a better test to provoke an SQLException within an XA operation.  My current test case, which shuts down the database causes an assertion on the server and a NPE on the client when run with network server.  Any ideas on a better test case would be welcome.  I don't really see the assertion and the NPE as bugs as Derby can't really be so defensive as to gracefully handle someone shutting the database down from underneath.\r\n\r\nThe patch is not tested and is not ready for commit, but adapts the client model of setting both the message and the errorCode for all XAExceptions.  If not one of the SQLStates with a straightforward mapping, it will set the errrorCode to XAER_RMFAIL for SESSION_SEVERITY or greater and XAER_RMERR for less severe errors. With the old code for embedded we would set either the message or the errorCode, but not both.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2009-04-09T20:33:42.963+0000","updated":"2009-04-09T20:33:42.963+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12421929/comment/12697664","id":"12697664","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"I see am.SqlCode has the disconnect exception at 40000, so I could use XAER_RMFAIL for those but I think that severe exceptions from the server don't get that code.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2009-04-09T21:49:16.207+0000","updated":"2009-04-09T21:49:16.207+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12421929/comment/12697671","id":"12697671","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Just closing the XAConnection gives me a good enough reproduction for the XAER_RMFAIL case and in that case the XAER_RMFAIL errrorCode seems to get transfered properly to client.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2009-04-09T22:10:02.829+0000","updated":"2009-04-09T22:10:02.829+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12421929/comment/12698027","id":"12698027","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"The attached patch (derby-4141_diff.txt) has the client and embedded changes and adds a test for the XAER_RMFAIL case.
