It appears that in both failing and passing case, m1 is the leftmost table in the query plan chosen for the queries. (I made one line change in my client to impl\\sql\\compile\\IndexToBaseRowNode.java where rather than just sending the table name, I send both table name and alias name to the query plan collection logic.

One of my question is should m1 get quailified to have sort avoidance set to true when we are not really ordering on any column that comes from m1?\r\n\r\nMoving on, once we finish with 0,-1,-1 where we decided that sorting can be avoided for m1, we move to the join order 0,1,-1. Again, we come to the code mentioned above for 0,1,-1\r\nif (requiredRowOrdering.sortRequired(currentRowOrdering,assignedTableMap) == RequiredRowOrdering.NOTHING_REQUIRED)\r\nIf the earlier decision for considering sort avoidance true for m1 was correct(for join order 0,-1,-1), we should definitely return sort avoidance false for join order 0,1,-1 because with m1 as the outermost table, we can't avoid sorting on m0. The 2 params at this point in code are as follows for the call above\r\nThe first param is currentRowOrdering\tRowOrderingImpl  (id=62)\t\r\n\talwaysOrderedOptimizables\tVector<E>  (id=99)\t\r\n\t\telementCount\t0\t\r\n\tcolumnsAlwaysOrdered\tColumnOrdering  (id=156)\t\r\n\t\tcolumns\tVector<E>  (id=245)\t\r\n\t\tmyDirection\t3\t\r\n\t\ttables\tVector<E>  (id=246)\t\r\n\tcurrentColumnOrdering\tColumnOrdering  (id=157)\t\r\n\t\tcolumns\tVector<E>  (id=252)\t\r\n\t\tmyDirection\t1\t\r\n\t\ttables\tVector<E>  (id=255)\t\r\n\tordering\tVector<E>  (id=103)\t\r\n\t\telementCount\t1\t\r\n\t\telementData\tObject[10]  (id=259)\t\r\n\t\tmodCount\t3\t\r\n\tunorderedOptimizables\tVector<E>  (id=104)\t\r\n\t\telementCount\t0\t\r\n(ColumnsAlwaysOrdered in currentRowOrdering is set to Direction: 3 Table 0, Column 3 Table 0, Column 2 Table 1, Column 2)\r\n(currentColumnOrdering in currentRowOrdering is set to Direction: 1 Table 1, Column 3)\r\n(ordering in currentRowOrdering is set to [Direction: 1 Table 1, Column 3])\r\nThe 2nd param assignedTableMap just has {0,1} because we are only considering 0 and 1 in the join order.\r\n\r\nGoing further deep in 0,1,-1 join order, the call above leads to following line in impl.sql.compile.OrderByList.sortRequired(RowOrdering, JBitSet) line: 535\t\r\nif ( ! rowOrdering.alwaysOrdered(cr.getTableNumber())) \r\n\r\nIn this if block, we say that sorting is not required. In my mind, we should required sorting because the outermost table m1 is not going to be able to satisfy the ordering requirement for m0.value and hence we can't consider sort avoidance when m1 is outermost. But of course, code is deciding that sort avoidance is ok in this case. I will highly appreciate if someone can help me understand this piece of code which ends up making the decision for sorting required or not required. I think the code is mostly centered in org.apache.derby.impl.sql.compile.RowOrderingImple (protocol class org.apache.derby.iapi.sql.compile.RowOrdering). There is not much of javadoc at the class level which is making it hard me to grasp what this class is supposed to do and what are the different memebers in it. I am going to debug further on my own to try to understand it but any help from community will be appreciated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

The join order is 0,-1,-1 when m1 decides that we can choose a plan which will avoid sorting. The code that makes that decision is in OrderByList.sortRequired(...), lines 496 - 533 Apparently, this code has been there since Cloudscape 2.0 days. \r\n\r\n**************Start of Army's analysis of the issue*******************\r\nThe comment preceding the code segment mentioned above says:\r\n\r\n            /*\r\n            ** Check whether the table referred to is in the table map (if any).\r\n            ** If it isn't, we may have an ordering that does not require\r\n            ** sorting for the tables in a partial join order.  Look for\r\n            ** columns beyond this column to see whether a referenced table\r\n            ** is found - if so, sorting is required (for example, in a\r\n            ** case like ORDER BY S.A, T.B, S.C, sorting is required).\r\n            */\r\n\r\nThe 2nd and 3rd line in comment confuses me.  The only time I can think of where we could assume \"sort avoidance\" was okay when a table number is missing would be if the ORDER BY expression did not refer to any tables, ex. if it was a constant:\r\n\r\n    ORDER BY 'some literal', m0.value\r\n\r\nBut from what I can tell, we catch that during preprocessing and remove the constant, so the above code still wouldn't be useful. (Note: the above ORDER BY will actually cause the query to return the correct results because the presence of a non-column expression (esp. the literal) causes the optimizer to ALWAYS perform a sort--that's a workaround to the problem if the user really needs one...).\r\n\r\nIf the code mentioned above was removed, then I think the optimizer would require sorting for the first optimizable (m1), and that would in turn mean that we have to sort for the entire join order--which should return the correct results.  Of course, the thought of just removing code that's been in there for years is a bit scary...It would be nice to understand what the intended use case was, but the comments are not clear about that at all.\r\n**************End of Army's analysis of the issue*******************\r\n\r\nBased on the above feedback, I commented out the code from 496-533 lines in OrderByList and ran the junit tests and they all ran fine. The old harness had one test case failing (lang/wisconsin) and it failed because the query plans now include sorting when the original plans (without my code changes) did not include sorting.  It appears that wisconsin test does not check the results of the cursors which are getting prepared. It just opens few cursors in order to get their query plans and dumps the query plans without checking the results of those queries. So I am not sure if the results from those queries have changed because of the additional sorting which is being added into their query plans.\r\n\r\nOfcourse, the problem query shown below works fine with the code commenting suggested by Army \r\nSELECT table1.id, m0.value, m1.value FROM  --DERBY-PROPERTIES joinOrder=FIXED \r\ntable2  m1 -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=key3\r\n,  table2 m0 -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=key3\r\n, table1 \r\nWHERE table1.id=m0.id AND m0.name='PageSequenceId' AND table1.id=m1.id AND m1.name='PostComponentId' AND m1.value='21857' ORDER BY m0.value;\r\n\r\nI would like to know what the community thinks of the code removal suggested by Army.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

I wish I had a clearer grasp on the concept of a 'partial join order'. I think that\r\nthis is an intermediate stage during optimization, where the optimizer has so far chosen an ordering\r\nfor some, but not yet all, of the tables. It looks like the code is trying to handle the problem of how\r\nto make a sort avoidance check at this intermediate point in optimization.\r\n\r\nI think that all *chosen* query plans eventually reach a *complete* join order, but a query plan which\r\nis *discarded* due to being too expensive may never get beyond a *partial* join order. Is that true?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that there may be two topics here:\r\n\r\n1) it would be valid to make such a check for the purposes of doing some preliminary costing of \r\nthe join order up to this point, but for such an algorithm, the code would have to then re-visit the \r\nsort avoidance decision later in the optimization, once the partial join order had become a full join order.\r\nThat is, I wonder if the overall flow is something like:\r\n - optimizer investigates a partial join order, decides to cost it, determines that (so far) a sort is not required.\r\n - optimizer later completes this join order, decides that it is acceptable, but does NOT re-analyze\r\n   whether a sort is now required for the complete join order\r\n - optimizer then chooses the correct full join order, but incorrectly avoids the sort due to the decision\r\n   it made when considering the partial join order.\r\n\r\n2) The comment (\"ORDER BY S.A, T.B, S.C\") raises the interesting question of the situation in\r\nwhich each column, considered individually, is ordered properly, but because the ORDER BY\r\nclause interleaves columns from different tables, a sort is still required. That is, if S had an index\r\non (A, C), and T had an index on B, we might look at ORDER BY S.A, T.B, S.C and think that no\r\nsorting of the results was required, because the join from S -> T would emit the rows in the\r\ncorrect order, but that is wrong; the interleaving of the columns means that the sort must still be performed.\r\nAnd, presumably, there is the interesting situation where we need to cost out a query at a point\r\nwhere we have determined a partial join order that contains a position for S, but not T, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know more about the Wisconsin test cases, about the queries involved, and\r\nabout the before- and after- query plan differences, with respect to sorting. Are *all* the changes due\r\nto situations where we formerly avoided a sort, but now we choose one? That's interesting, I think; we\r\nwant to be careful to avoid introducing un-necessary sorts because that could be a substantial\r\nperformance regression (of course, if the old query was returning the rows in the wrong order, but\r\nthe test didn't check, and the new query is now being performed correctly, that's important to know, too!)\r\n\r\nIt would also be interesting to see if we can construct an example along the lines of the\r\nORDER BY S.A, T.B, S.C case, such that various other permutations (ORDER BY S.A, S.C, T.B or\r\nORDER BY T.B, S.A, S.C) did not require sorting, but ORDER BY S.A, T.B, S.C did, and see how\r\nthe query plans emitted for these various cases behaved.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2009-04-16T14:42:44.627+0000","updated":"2009-04-16T14:42:44.627+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407399/comment/12699728","id":"12699728","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

And as I re-think about this, perhaps the code was written for a situation like\r\n\r\n    \"ORDER BY S.A, T.B\"    -- Note that we do *NOT* have \"S.C\".\r\n\r\nIn that case a partial join order with \"S\" would satisfy the first order by column, and the second order by colum, \"T.B\", would have a table that is not in the join order.  Without the logic in question, I think the method would determine that a sort was required because table \"T\" wasn't found.  But the logic in question would see if there was anything 'after' T.B, and since there isn't, it would say that the partial join order can avoid a sort *so far*, with the assumption that if the next optimizable to be placed in the join order is \"T\", we might be able to avoid the sort entirely.\r\n\r\nAs soon as \"S.C\" gets added to the list, though, the logic sees that we have interleaving columns and therefore correctly requires a sort.\r\n\r\nSo *if* that's a correct statement of how the code is *supposed* to work, then it is actually quite useful and it does make sense.  But there seems to be a glitch in the logic--namely, it should perhaps require that a) all of the tables for the LEADING SET of order by columns, up to the one whose table cannot be found, MUST exist within the join order, *and* b) the leading set of order by columns canNOT be empty.  I think the code as written checks for \"a\", but it does not check for \"b\".\r\n\r\nSo in the query for this issue, we have \"ORDER BY m0.value\".  When we get a partial join order with { m1 } in it, we check the order by column \"m0.value\" and find that \"m0\" is not in the (partial) join order.  Today, due to the lack of condition \"b\", we think we can avoid the sort.  But if condition \"b\" was in place, we would see that the \"leading set\" of order by columns--i.e. the number of order by columns before \"m0.value\", is EMPTY, which means that \"so far\" nothing is sorted, and thus the sort would be required.\r\n\r\nI haven't actually tried that out, I'm just writing as things occur to me, so this could be incomplete and/or entirely incorrect...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2009-04-16T16:12:50.650+0000","updated":"2009-04-16T16:12:50.650+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407399/comment/12699744","id":"12699744","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"body":"> if condition \"b\" was in place, we would see that the \"leading set\" of order by\r\n> columns--i.e. the number of order by columns before \"m0.value\", is EMPTY,\r\n> which means that \"so far\" nothing is sorted, and thus the sort would be required.\r\n\r\nOne easy way to check this theory would be to make the following change:\r\n\r\n@@ -503,7 +503,7 @@\r\n                        */\r\n                        if (tableMap != null)\r\n                        {\r\n-                               if ( ! tableMap.get(cr.getTableNumber()))\r\n+                               if ((position > 0) && !tableMap.get(cr.getTableNumber()))\r\n                                {\r\n                                        /* Table not in partial join order */\r\n                                        for (int remainingPosition = loc + 1;\r\n\r\nand see what happens...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2009-04-16T16:16:00.480+0000","updated":"2009-04-16T16:16:00.480+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407399/comment/12699755","id":"12699755","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"body":"> *and* b) the leading set of order by columns canNOT be empty.\r\n\r\nOkay, check that, that's not a complete solution.\r\n\r\nConsider\r\n\r\n    ORDER BY S.A, T.B\r\n\r\nwith a join order of { S, W, - }.\r\n\r\nIf we can avoid sorting for S.A and then we process \"T.B\" and say that we can avoid the sort there, as well, we'll get into trouble.

It was painful to convert the setup script provided for this jira into a junit test. The script is huge. I was able to use Army's test converter DERBY-2151(it was extremely helpful because it atleast converted half of the script into junit test. My understanding is that the converter works on the older canon based master file. I think it takes sql delimited by ; from the canon file and assumes that next line is the output of that sql.

The diffs were for 7 queries and for those 7 queries, now the plan picked does a sorting (prior to my changes, the sorting was getting avoided). wisconsin test only does query plan dump, it does not check the actual data returned for those queries. For the 7 queries that changed, I added a check to dump the data returned from those queries. Rerunning wisconsin with and without my code changes atleast confirms that the data returned because of the additional sorting node has not been affected. All of these 7 queries involved multiple tables in the FROM list and they had ORDER BY clause. (I have included the 7 queries below for reference).\r\n\r\nI went through all the queries in wisconsin test and see that there are still quite a few queries (even the ones with more than one table in the FROM list and have ORDER BY) that do not have sorting node on top of their query plan because of the commenting of the code. One of such query example is\r\nget cursor c as\r\n\t'select * from TENKTUP1, TENKTUP2\r\n\t where TENKTUP1.unique1 = TENKTUP2.unique1\r\n\t and TENKTUP2.unique1 < 6000\r\n\t order by TENKTUP1.unique1';\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW, the 7 queries that have changed their plans so that they now require sorting are as follows(Note that the comment for the query 2 \"says that sort avoidance with joins and order by on columns in different tables\".

Of course, more tracing/debugging of the individual queries would be necessary to know for sure...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2009-04-23T21:03:01.624+0000","updated":"2009-04-23T21:03:01.624+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407399/comment/12702137","id":"12702137","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"I took a close look at the original query plans for queries 1 through 3, and believe all of the original \r\nquery plans with no sort at the top are valid plans.  So think the current fix may not be valid as it is causing sort where they do not need to be.  I am new to this, so if my logic is wrong please point it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nFor query 1:\r\n1)\r\nij> -- one row from joining table\r\nget cursor c as\r\n\t'select * from TENKTUP1, TENKTUP2\r\n\t where TENKTUP1.unique2 = TENKTUP2.unique2\r\n\t and TENKTUP2.unique1 = 0\r\n\t order by TENKTUP1.unique1';\r\n\r\nBecause TENKTUP2.unique1 is a unique column and the query requires TENKTUP2.unique1 = 0,\r\nonly 1 or 0 rows qualifies from TENKTUP2.   Because TENKTUP2.unique2 and TENKTUP1.unique2 are \r\nalso both unique then TENKTUP1.unique2 = TENKTUP2.unique2 means only 1 or 0 rows qualify\r\nqualify from TENKTUP1.  This means the query can only return 1 or 0 rows.  Because this is the\r\ncase there is no need to sort a 1 or 0 row result set.\r\n\r\nMy question is, is it expected that the optimizer should recognize that a one row result set requires \r\nno ordering?  \r\n\r\nIt looks like queries 3 through 7 are all variations on one row result sets.\r\n\r\nQuery 2 is different:\r\nget cursor c as\r\n\t'select * from TENKTUP1, TENKTUP2\r\n\t where TENKTUP1.unique1 = TENKTUP2.unique1\r\n\t order by TENKTUP1.unique1, TENKTUP2.unique1';\r\n\r\nIn this case the interesting thing is that TENKTUP1.unique1 must be the same as \r\nTENKTUP2.unique1.  So this means that any plan that is sorted on TENKTUP1.unique1 OR\r\nTENKTUP2.unique1 fulfills the order by requirement to be sorted by TENKTUP1.unique1, TENKTUP2.unique1.\r\n\r\nSo in the original queryplan it turns out the outermost index scan is:\r\nTENKTUP1 using index TK1UNIQUE1  which because of the predicate is enough to avoid sorting.\r\n\r\nAgain the question is whether the code is meant to catch this case or did it get lucky?\r\n\r\nOriginally I have to admit I didn't understand how any multiple table order by could be a sort \r\navoidance plan since we have no indexes that cover multiple tables.  I believe the above show\r\nsome of the cases.\r\n\r\nAnother case I have seen is an order by of A.key, B.key being satisfied by join on A.key, B.key when it is known A.key is a single value.  Or satisfied also by join on B.key, A.key where it is also known that\r\nA is a single value like A.key = ?. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2009-04-23T22:12:35.740+0000","updated":"2009-04-23T22:12:35.740+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407399/comment/12702147","id":"12702147","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"body":"I haven't looked at the details of your previous post, but regarding:\r\n\r\n> So think the current fix may not be valid as it is causing sort where they do not need to be.\r\n\r\nI agree.  That's what I was hoping to convey in my comment on April 16th when I wrote:\r\n\r\n> *if* that's a correct statement of how the code is *supposed* to work, then it is actually\r\n> quite useful and it does make sense.\r\n\r\nI.e. we shouldn't remove it.  As for:\r\n\r\n> is it expected that the optimizer should recognize that a one row result set requires\r\n> no ordering? \r\n\r\nI don't know the details of how it works, but there is definitely logic in the optimizer to try to recognize one row result sets and to make decisions based on that information.  The RowOrderingImpl.java class even includes a field called \"alwaysOrderedOptimizables\" for which the javadoc says:\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n    ** This vector contains table numbers for tables that are always ordered.\r\n    ** This happens for one-row tables.\r\n    */\r\n\r\nNot sure how that plays into the above queries, but I thought I'd mention it...\r\n\r\n> Another case I have seen is an order by of A.key, B.key being satisfied by join on\r\n> A.key, B.key when it is known A.key is a single value\r\n\r\nYes, I think that's what the \"columnsAlwaysOrdered\" field in RowOrderingImpl seems to be for.  Any columns which are compared to constants (and probably parameter markers as well?) are considered \"always ordered\" and hence should not require sorting in and of themselves.  Ex. In the query for this issue the columnsAlwaysOrdered field includes columns m0.name, m1.name, and m1.value because all of those columns are compared to literals in the WHERE clause.  It seems quite possible that the optimizer will apply these rules transitively to detect other \"always ordered\" columns as well...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2009-04-23T22:45:26.841+0000","updated":"2009-04-23T22:45:26.841+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407399/comment/12703011","id":"12703011","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tjoris","name":"tjoris","emailAddress":"tars dot joris at inventivedesigners dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tars Joris","active":true},"body":"Test script that can be included in the Test-Suite.\r\n\r\nSome data was changed, but I verified that it still reproduced the bug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tjoris","name":"tjoris","emailAddress":"tars dot joris at inventivedesigners dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tars Joris","active":true},"created":"2009-04-27T07:22:46.163+0000","updated":"2009-04-27T07:22:46.163+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407399/comment/12703351","id":"12703351","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

Satoor","active":true},"body":"I went through the optimize phase through the debugger and it appears to me (I may be wrong and would appreciate others looking at my detail analysis of the optimize phase below) that the problem may be with the generate phase or the execute phase where we may be not using the non-unique index on table2 correctly to fetch the orders in row.\r\n\r\nThe query in question is as below\r\nSELECT table1.id, table2.value, table3.value FROM --DERBY-PROPERTIES joinOrder=FIXED\r\ntable3 -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=nonUniqueOnValue_Table3\r\n, table2 -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=nonUniqueOnValue_Table2\r\n, table1\r\nWHERE table1.id=table2.id AND table2.name='PageSequenceId' \r\nAND table1.id=table3.id \r\nAND table3.name='PostComponentId' \r\nAND table3.value='21857' ORDER BY table2.value;\r\n\r\nFor the query above, in addition to the predicates supplied by the user, optimizer internally generates another predicate, namely, table3.id=table2.id\r\nSo for the queyr, all the predicates are as follows\r\n1)table1.id=table2.id \r\n2)table1.id=table3.id \r\n3)table3.id=table2.id\r\n4)table2.name='PageSequenceId' \r\n5)table3.name='PostComponentId' \r\n6)table3.value='21857' \r\n\r\nOf the predicates above, 4), 5) and 6) can be pushed down to the corresponding optimizables ie 4) will be associated with table2 and 5),6) will be associated with table3. This is because these predicates are constant comparison with columns. This leaves us with 3 predicates, namely 1), 2), 3)\r\nwhich are multitable join predicates.\r\n\r\nOptimizer has a class called RowOrdering associated with it (OptimizerImpl.currentRowOrdering). \r\ncurrentRowOrdering has following fields in it.\r\ncurrentRowOrdering\tRowOrderingImpl  \r\n\talwaysOrderedOptimizables\tVector<E>\r\n\tcolumnsAlwaysOrdered\tColumnOrdering\r\n\tcurrentColumnOrdering\tnull\t\r\n\tordering\tVector<E>  \r\n\tunorderedOptimizables\tVector<E>  \r\nAll the predicates that are constant comparison will go into columnsAlwaysOrdered. These pushing of constant comparison predicates happen per optimizable basis when that particular optimizable is being consdiered in the possible join order combination.\r\n\r\nIn our specific query, through optimizer overrides, we have instructed optimizer to only consider join order [table3, table2, table1]. The optimizer starts with [table3, -1, -1]. First thing it does is it goes through the join predicates (which are 1), 2) and 3) in the predicate list above). But since\r\nall the referenced tables for any of the 3 predicates are not covered by the current join order of [table3, -1, -1], nothing gets done to those join predicates. Next, the optimizer will tell \r\ncurrentRowOrdering to (this happens in FromBaseTable(FromTable).tellRowOrderingAboutConstantColumns(RowOrdering, OptimizablePredicateList) line: 1477) to add predicates 5) and 6) from above list into it's columnsAlwaysOrdered list. So, at the end of the\r\n[table3, -1, -1], currentRowOrdering.columnsAlwaysOrdered will look as follows \r\nDirection: 3 Table 0, Column 3 Table 0, Column 2\r\nWe are saying above that Table at position 0 (which is Table3 in our eg) has column 3(value) and column 2(name) which are always ordered because they are being compared with constants. So far, the logic for currentRowOrdering seems to be working fine. Next, we have asked the optimizer to use the index index=nonUniqueOnValue_Table3 on Table3. This index covers the predicate 6) since that predicate is on the same column on which the index is created but it does not cover the other columns from table3 that are being referenced in this query (which table3.id and table3.name). Because of this, we determine that the index being considered is not a covering index. The code to determine whether the sorting can be avoided for [table3, -1, -1], is in OrderByList.sortRequired(RowOrdering, JBitSet) method. Since order by is on table2.value, the order by column's table does not match with table3 and hecne we determine that sorting is not required based on what optimizer has seen so far. So it appears that we leave it to table2 when its turn comes in the join order to decide whether sorting should indeed be avoided or not.\r\n\r\nNext we consider the join order [table3, table2, -1]. For table2, we have asked the optimizer to use index=nonUniqueOnValue_Table2. First thing that we do is go through the join predicates 1), 2) and 3). Predicate number 3) which is TABLE3.ID = TABLE2.ID can be pushed down to optimizable table2 because the current join order [table3, table2, -1] includes the tables referenced by predicate 3). So, at this point, there are 2 predicates pushed down to table3, they are number 5) and 6). And for table2, there are 2 prdicates pushed down to it, they are number 3) and 4). Also, since predicate 4) is a constant comparison, it will get added to currentRowOrdering. At this point, currentRowOrdering.columnsAlwaysOrdered will look as folows\r\nDirection: 3 Table 0, Column 3 Table 0, Column 2 Table 1, Column 2\r\nWe are saying above that Table at position 0 (which is Table3 in our eg) has column 3(value) and column 2(name) which are always ordered because they are being compared with constants. In addition, Table at position 1(which is Table2 in our join order) has column 2 which is always ordered because it is being compared with constant. Next, we have asked the optimizer to use the index nonUniqueOnValue_Table2 but it does not cover the constant comparison predicate 4) since that predicate is on column name and not value. Notice, this is a different code path we are following for table2 compared to table3 above. Because table3.value is not already an ordered column in currentRowOrdering because there is no\r\nconstant comparison predicate on it, we add it to the \"ordering \" vector in currentOrdering object. This is the first object that gets added to the currentRowOrdering.\"ordering\" vector in our eg. So, at this point, the currentRowOrdering has only 3 of it's fields propulated and they are as follows\r\ncolumnsAlwaysOrdered\tColumnOrdering\r\n\tDirection: 3 Table 0, Column 3 Table 0, Column 2 Table 1, Column 2\r\ncurrentColumnOrdering\tColumnOrdering \r\n\tDirection: 1 Table 1, Column 3\r\nordering\tVector<E>  \r\n\t[Direction: 1 Table 1, Column 3]\r\nThe index nonUniqueOnValue_Table2 does not cover any predicate on Table2 and it does not cover all the column from table2 that are being referenced in this query and hence it is not a covering index. Next, the code to determine whether sort can be avoided for join order [table3, table2, -1], we go through the code path in OrderByList.sortRequired(RowOrdering, JBitSet) method. We find that the order by column's table matches with table2 in join order. Because of this match, we need to look at currentRowOrdering to see if it will take care of the sorting and if so we can avoid the sort. To look into currentRowOrdering, we first call currentRowOrdering.alwaysOrdered(cr.getTableNumber()) (in this call, cr is the order by column). So, we are checking if table2 is always ordered in currentRowOrdering. Since table2 is not always ordered in this query, this check returns false. Next, we check if not the entire table, is the order by table.order by column combination always ordered in currentRowOrdering. In our query, that will be table2.value Since there is no constant comparison predicate on table2.value, it is not going to be in columnsAlwaysOrdered vector in currentRowOrdering.\r\nFor reference, currentRowOrdering looks as follws\r\ncolumnsAlwaysOrdered\tColumnOrdering\r\n\tDirection: 3 Table 0, Column 3 Table 0, Column 2 Table 1, Column 2\r\ncurrentColumnOrdering\tColumnOrdering \r\n\tDirection: 1 Table 1, Column 3\r\nordering\tVector<E>  \r\n\t[Direction: 1 Table 1, Column 3]\r\nAs we can see from currentRowOrdering object above, columnsAlwaysOrdered does not include Table 1, Column 3. So, we have not found table2 to be always ordered and we have not found table2.value to be always ordered either. The last place to check is the ordering vector in columnsAlwaysOrdered. This vector does include Table 1, Column 3 which is table2.value and hence we determine that sorting is not needed to table2. All this code of checking the columnsAlwaysOrdered happens in OrderByList.sortRequired(RowOrdering, JBitSet). Assuming that this code is working as intended, I think then the culprit might be when we generate the code. The only step in optimize left is to add table1 to the join order. So, at the end of the optimize phase, the join order will look as follows [table3, table2, table1] and currentRowOrdering looks as follows\r\ncolumnsAlwaysOrdered\tColumnOrdering\r\n\tDirection: 3 Table 0, Column 3 Table 0, Column 2 Table 1, Column 2\r\ncurrentColumnOrdering\tColumnOrdering \r\n\tDirection: 1 Table 2, Column 1\r\nordering\tVector<E>  \r\n\t[Direction: 1 Table 1, Column 3, Direction: 1 Table 2, Column 1]\r\n\r\nThe only change to currentRowOrdering that is caused by adding of table1 in third join order position is that we are going to use primary key on table1 and hence we need to reflect that in currentRowOrdering by adding it to the ordering vector.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

This would be a correct assumption if table3 returned a single\r\nrow, but not correct when it returns multiple rows.\r\n\r\nIn the bug case it looks to me like table3 returns 3 rows where\r\ntable3.value = 21857.\r\n\r\ntable3.id  | table3.value\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n2147483653 |21857\r\n2147483654 |21857\r\n4294967297 |21857\r\n\r\nNow the next part of the join has been forced to use\r\ntable2.nonUniqueOnValue_Table2, which is not useful other than providing\r\nsorted access, so it turns into a table scan. The key is that it turns\r\ninto 3 table scans, searching for table3.id=table2.id leading to:\r\n\r\nID         |table2.VALUE |VALUE\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n2147483653 |000002       |21857\r\n2147483654 |000003       |21857\r\n4294967297 |000001       |21857\r\n\r\nThe code does THREE full scan using the index and thus the rows are not\r\nordered by table2.value.  So even though we are using a key that should give\r\nus the correct sorted order on table2.value, we are traversing it more than\r\nonce so it does not matter.  If the probes had been done using a single\r\nscan with something like where (id = 2147483653 or 2147483654 or 4294967297)\r\nit would have been sorted correctly, but that is not how joins work.\r\n\r\nI believe the execution code is doing the right thing.

Thus the order of the result is based solely on the order of the rows that are retrieved from the outer table.\r\n\r\nSome observations about what was necessary to get this particular repro to work:\r\n\r\n  1) The outer table (T1) has a non-unique index on column I1, and we force the optimizer to use that non-unique index.\r\n\r\n      Why? If the optimizer were to use a table scan for T1 then we would check to see if T1 was a \"oneRowResultSet\", which it isn't (and can't be, since we need T1 to return multiple rows in order to satisfy observation 3 below).  Since it's not a one-row result set T1 would then get added to the list of \"unordered optimizables\" for the join order--and if that list has at least one optimizable in it, we would end up doing an explicit sort and thus the problem would not repro.  So the plan for T1 must use an index.\r\n\r\n  2) There is a predicate in the WHERE clause which compares the non-unique indexed column T1.I1 to a CONSTANT expression.\r\n\r\n      Why? If such a predicate did not exist then T1.I1 would be added as the first column in the \"rowOrdering\" for the join order.  Then when the optimizer adds the middle table (T2) to the join order, it would see that the index for T2 does *not* satisfy the ordering requirement of T1.I1, which means we would end up doing an explicit sort for the whole plan.  So the problem would not repro.  By adding a predicate to compare T1.I1 with a constant, we effectively make T1.I1 \"always ordered\" and so we do not need to add it to the row ordering.\r\n\r\n  3) The outer table (T1) has multiple rows which have the same value for the indexed column T1.I1.\r\n\r\n      Why? The presence of multiple rows is important because that's what leads to multiple scans on the middle table (as pointed out by Mike and Mamta).  So we need to have a predicate which compares to a fixed constant value (observation 2), but we also need that predicate to return multiple rows.  Thus there must be multiple rows in T1 which have I1 column values that equal the constant value used in the predicate.  (This is why the index for T1 must be non-unique.)\r\n\r\n  4) The middle table (T2) has an index that is ordered the same way as the ORDER BY clause.  We force the optimizer to use that index for T2.\r\n\r\n      Why? If the optimizer is using an index that satisfies the ordering requirement for the query, it will try to avoid sorting the resultant rows.  Sort avoidance is key to reproducing the reported behavior--esp. the optimizer *thinks* it can avoid the sort, and does so, but in truth it should *not* have done so.\r\n\r\n  5) The index for T2 is not covering--and esp. it does *not* include the column T2.I2 that is used for joining with the outer table.\r\n\r\n      Why? The fact that the index is non-covering means that we will have to go to the T2 table conglomerate to fetch the row that has the current join value--and access to the table conglomerate is _unordered_.\r\n\r\n  6)  The column from T1 (outer table) that is joined with T2 (middle table) has varied values for each of the rows.\r\n\r\n      Why? The presence of different values in T1.J1 means that we will scan T2's table conglomerate multiple times for different T2.I2 values, and since the table conglomerate is unordered (observation 5), those multiple scans will return the rows in an order that does *not* match the index order.\r\n\r\n  7) The rows that are inserted into T2 are inserted in an order that does NOT match the ORDER BY ordering.\r\n\r\n      Why? It appears that, when inserting rows into a table, the order of the rows in the base table conglomerate generally matches the insertion order.  I don't think there are any guarantees of that, but that's what I observed for this simple data.  So if we were to insert the rows in proper order, access to the base table conglomerate (observations 5 & 6) might in fact return the rows in the desired order by accident, which would hide the problem that we're trying to reproduce.\r\n\r\nWith all of those observations in place, I was able to write the attached script to reproduce the problem for me.  The results I see when I run are:\r\n\r\nJ1         |J2  |J3\r\n---------------------------\r\n0          |f   |five\r\n1          |g   |six\r\n2          |e   |four\r\n\r\nbut the query specifies \"ORDER BY t2.j2\", so the rows are in the wrong order.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if others could try to run the script to make sure they see the same behavior (if not, then some or all of this comment may in fact be wrong or incomplete...).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2009-05-06T16:28:30.158+0000","updated":"2009-05-06T16:28:30.158+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407399/comment/12706509","id":"12706509","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

This pretty much makes the index of no use but say the optimizer has been forced to use that index through optimizer overrides (ie what we have done in our test queries in this jira). If the outer tables in the join order are all one-row resultset, then it is not an issues because we will be doing only one scan on the optimizable in question and all the rows returned for that optimizable will be sorted on the index being considered on optimizable. The problem case is when there are outer optimizable involved and the outer optimizables will qualify more than one row which will be returned for them and for each one of those rows, we will be doing a scan on the optimizable in question and hence the rows satisfied through multiple scans of the optimizable in question will not be in any sorted order.

My patch is adding sort node for the query from the wisconsin test as shown below is\r\nconnect 'jdbc:derby:wombat';\r\nselect * from tenktup1, tenktup2\r\nwhere tenktup1.unique1 = tenktup2.unique1\r\norder by tenktup1.unique1;\r\nI think the reason for the sort node might be the code below that I have added in my patch\r\nif (currentRowOrdering.orderingRequiredOnTable(optimizable.getTableNumber()))\r\n\r\nWith the if statement above, I was trying to see if the current optimizable is covering some columns from the order by and if there are constant predicates on those column. I am trying to do this by just looking at currentRowOrdering object. I think the correct code should look at both requiredRowOrdering provided by the user and current row ordering info for the current join order as collected by the optimizer in the currentRowOrdering object. I will work on fixing the if statement code above to see if it gets rid of the sort node for the query above.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

Satoor","active":true},"body":"I have attached a patch (DERBY3926_patch3_051509_diff.txt)  that fixes the reproducible order by query case. The problem was that when considering inner optimizable nodes that required ordering(but the user query has no constant comparison predicate(s) on those columns), we did not check if the previous optimizables all returned single rows before deciding to avoid sorting. If the previous optimizables return more than one row, then that would require multiple scans into the inner optimizable and the rows satisfied by the multiple scans may or may not be ordered as per the user query requirement. \r\n\r\nThe new logic has gone into impl\\sql\\compile\\OptimizerImpl.java and the supporting code to determine if the current inner optimizable requires ordering on columns with no constant comparison predicates on them is in impl\\sql\\compile\\OrderByList.java\r\n\r\nThe logic has also been explained in detail in OptimizerImpl.java I will appreciate if someone can take a look at it. I have run junit tests and derbyall. There are two failures in derbyall. One of them is for T_RawStoreFactory which I think is existing known jira issue DERBY-3993. The other failure is in wisconsin test. Only one sql is failing in wisconsin. That sql with some optimizer overrides looks as follows.\r\nselect * from   --DERBY-PROPERTIES joinOrder=FIXED \r\nTENKTUP1   -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=TK1UNIQUE1\r\n, TENKTUP2  -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=TK2UNIQUE1\r\nwhere TENKTUP1.unique1 = TENKTUP2.unique1\r\norder by TENKTUP1.unique1, TENKTUP2.unique1;\r\n\r\nAs the name of the columns suggest, there are unique indexes on the columns we are dealing with in the query above. With my changes in the patch, now we are requiring a sort on the top of the query plan. Prior to my changes, we were avoiding sort on this query. The reason we are requiring sort as per the new logic is - The outermost optimizable is TENKTUP1 and it is going to return more than one row. Next, we consider TENKTUP2 as the inner optimizable. We see that user has requested ordering on\r\nTENKTUP2.unique1 and there is no constant predicate on TENKTUP2.unique1 AND the previous optimizable is not one row resultset and because of these conditions, we require that sorting is necessary. I think ideally, we should be able to avoid sort because even though the previous optimizable is returning more than one row, the current optimizable has equality check with the previous optimizable (on the ordered columns) and hence even though there will be multiple scans into current optimizable, the rows will\r\nall be ordered because of the equality check. I haven't given this additional logic much thought. I will look more into it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

Thanks much for the careful writeups and explanations.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the problem with the current Wisconsin query has to do with the precise definition of \"one row result set\".\r\n\r\nIf we go back to Mike's original insight some time ago, he said:\r\n\r\n> the key here is that the outer table(table3) is returning more than one row and\r\n> each one of those row is requiring us to look at the middle table (table2) which\r\n> results into 3 scans on table2\r\n\r\nAnd that seems correct to me. But at some point I think we lost the \"AND\" part of Mike's statement\r\nwhen it was translated into the bits-and-bytes of actual code.\r\n\r\nThat is, in the Wisconsin query in question, the outer table (TENKTUP1) is returning\r\nmore than one row, *however* each one of those rows only results in a single\r\nopen of the inner table (TENKTUP2), because the join key is unique.\r\n\r\nThis comment from the patch seems to describe the essence of the issue:\r\n\r\n+\t * ... and hence we need to make sure \r\n+\t * that the outer predicates in the join order are all\r\n+\t * one row optimizables meaning that they can at the\r\n+\t * most return only one row.

Outer predicates which\r\nare *not* one row result sets should still be able to perform sort avoidance plans, *as long as*\r\nthe join condition will perform only a single open of the inner optimizable.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2009-05-20T19:25:33.544+0000","updated":"2009-05-20T19:25:33.544+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407399/comment/12711781","id":"12711781","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

If not,then we check if the column is already being ordered by checking ordering vector at line 133. If not, we go ahead and add the index column to the ordering vector in currentRowOrdering object.\r\n\r\nGoing to the query above when the optimizer is going through the join order [0, -1] which means it is considering TENKTUP1 at the outermost join order position and no optimizable has yet been considered in the next position yet. For TENKTUP1, we go through the above piece of code. The method RowOrderingImpl.orderedOnColumn is going to return false for the index column UNIQUE1(index TK1UNIQUE1 is on that column) because \r\na)TENKTUP1 is not always ordered meaning it is not one-row table\r\nb)there is no constant predicate on TENKTUP1.UNIQUE1\r\nc)there is no other ordering on TENKTUP1.UNIQUE1\r\n\r\nSince for our query, the index column UNIQUE1 is not already ordered yet in the currentRowOrdering object, we go ahead and add it to the ordering vector inside currentRowOrdering object (this is done in FromBaseTable.nextAccessPath at line: 484 with following 2 code lines.)\r\n\trowOrdering.nextOrderPosition(isAscending[i] ? RowOrdering.ASCENDING : RowOrdering.DESCENDING);\r\n\trowOrdering.addOrderedColumn(isAscending[i] ? RowOrdering.ASCENDING : RowOrdering.DESCENDING,\r\n\t\tgetTableNumber(), baseColumnPositions[i]);\r\nThis adding of TENKTUP1.UNIQUE1 to ordering object will indicate that the rows are ordered on that column. So, at the end of considering access path for [0, -1] join order position, currentRowOrdering object will have TENKTUP1.UNIQUE1 in ordering vector and it will be marked as the current column ordering (this is done by having currentColumnOrdering = TENKTUP1.UNIQUE1). \r\n\r\nNext, we work on finding the cost of the given access path for [0, -1] join order. Once we find the cost, we check to see if it makes sense to avoid sort on it from what we know so far. This is done in OptimizerImpl.costBasedCostOptimizable through following piece of code\r\n\tif (considerSortAvoidance && requiredRowOrdering.sortRequired(currentRowOrdering,\r\n\t\tassignedTableMap) == RequiredRowOrdering.NOTHING_REQUIRED)\r\nWhat we are doing here is checking if the ordering requested by the user for the current table (that information is in requiredRowOrdering) is satisfied by row ordering provided by the join order being considered so far. The row ordering provided for the current join order is in currentRowOrdering. In our specific eg, since user has requested for ordering on TENKTUP1.UNIQUE1 and we are ordering on it because of the index that is being used, the above call to requiredRowOrdering.sortRequired is going to return sorting not required.\r\n\r\nNext, we put the next optimizable in the join order, meaning moving from [0,-1] join order to [0, 1]. At this point, optimizer is considering TENKTUP2 in the 2nd join order position. We have asked the optimizer to use index TK2UNIQUE1 for optimizable TENKTUP2. We go through the same code path as above for this optimizable. We will find that the index column TENKTUP2.unique1 needs to be added to ordering vector in currentRowOrdering because TENKTUP2 is not one-row table and there is no constant predicate on TENKTUP2.unique1 and hence the current index being considered on TENKTUP2 is going to provide ordering on TENKTUP2.unique1. Next, we see if sort can be aovided for TENKTUP2 by comparing required row ordering against current row ordering. User has required ordering on TENKTUP2.unique1 and current row ordering satisfies that ordering because of the index which is being considered for TENKTUP2.\r\n\r\nSo, if my understanding of code is correct, the sorting is getting avoided NOT based on the fact that equality condition exists between the two optimizables ie TENKTUP1.unique1 = TENKTUP2.unique1 In other words, sorting avoidacne decision was not based on TENKTUP1.unique1 = TENKTUP2.unique1 It was because optimizer decides that the individual sorting required on the optimizables have been satisfied by indexes picked on them.\r\n\r\nHope this helps understand the current behavior of the trunk code for the query in question.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

This patch takes care of the original problem query and one query from wisconsin which was getting an unnecessary sort node on it with the previous patch (DERBY3926_patch5_052709_stat.txt). \r\n\r\nFollowing are the files that were touched by the patch.\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\RowOrderingImpl.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\OrderByList.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\FromBaseTable.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\OptimizerImpl.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\sql\\compile\\PredicateList.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\iapi\\sql\\compile\\RowOrdering.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\iapi\\sql\\compile\\RequiredRowOrdering.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\iapi\\sql\\compile\\OptimizablePredicateList.java\r\nM      java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\lang\\wisc_setup.sql\r\nM      java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\lang\\_Suite.java\r\nM      java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\lang\\OrderByAndSortAvoidance.java\r\nM      java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\master\\wisconsin.out\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing is the patch description.\r\nThe problem with the trunk codeline is that when optimizer goes through optimizables in a join order, it only looks at those optimizables individually to decide whether sorting can be avoided on them or not. That approach leaves out few queries which require sorting but do not get sorted. The decision for avoiding sorting should also include relationship between the optimizables in a given join order. Following query demonstrates the trunk problem\r\nSELECT table1.id, table2.value, table3.value FROM --DERBY-PROPERTIES joinOrder=FIXED \r\ntable3 -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=nonUniqueOnValue_Table3 \r\n, table2 -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=nonUniqueOnValue_Table2 \r\n, table1 \r\nWHERE table1.id=table2.id AND table2.name='PageSequenceId' \r\nAND table1.id=table3.id \r\nAND table3.name='PostComponentId' \r\nAND table3.value='21857' ORDER BY table2.value; \r\n\r\nIn the query above, when optimizer is considering [table3, table2, -1] join order, it determines that sorting can be avoided on this join order because the order by column table2.value is already covered by the index nonUniqueOnValue_Table2. It does not see that the outermost optimizable table3 will qualify more than one row and hence it will be a multi-row resulset and for each one of those rows, we will be doing a scan into table2. In other words, there will be multiple scans into table2(and the rows returned by each one of those scans will be ordered on table2.value) but the collective rows from those multiple scans are not necessarily going to be ordered on table2.value. This patch is attempting to fix that problem.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in trunk, a column is marked always ordered during a query processing when the optimizer finds that there is constant comparison predicate on the order by column. If the column does not have a constant predicate (as in our example above), we next see if we are using an index which will provide the required ordering on column (which is true in our case. The required ordering on table2.value is provided by the index nonUniqueOnValue_Table2). But as we can see in the query above, this index coverage is not enough to say that sorting is not needed. We need to add 2 more conditions before we can decide to avoid the sorting. One of those cases is 1)if the order by column does not belong to the outermost optimizable, then check if the order by column's optimizable is a one-row resultset. If yes, then it will be safe for the optimizer to avoid the sorting. The second case to consider is 2)if the order by column does not belong to the outermost optimizable, then check if the order by column's optimizable is multi-row resultset BUT all the outer optimizables are one-row resulsets. If either of these 2 additional conditions are satisfied then optimizer can choose to avoid the sorting. Otherwise\r\nsorting should be added to the query plan. The example query above does not satisfy the 2 additional checks and hence sorting should be done as part of the query plan.\r\n\r\nThe changes for the 1)check above has gone into OrderbyByList.sortRequired(RowOrdering, JBitSet, OptimizableList). The implementation of this change just required us to check the outer optimizables to be one row since the order by column's optimizable is not one row. If outer optimizables are all one-row, then we say that sorting can be avoided. Otherwise sorting is required.\r\n\r\nThe changes for the 2)check above has gone into FromBaseTable.nextAccessPath(Optimizer optimizer, OptimizablePredicateList predList, RowOrdering rowOrdering) The implementation of this change requires us to see if the order by column is involved in equijoin with outer optimizable's indexed column. If yes, then we know that since outer optimizable is ordered, the rows qualified via the equijoin will also be ordered and hence sorting can be avoided. But if this is not true, then we can't rely on outer optimizables' rows to be ordered on the order by column. To avoid sorting, we need to identify this case 2) as another case when the column can be marked as always ordered and that is when there is an equijoin predicate on the order by column with some other column\r\nwhich is already known to be always ordered. Taking the query from wisconsin as an example will explain this behavior\r\nselect * from --DERBY-PROPERTIES joinOrder=FIXED \r\nTENKTUP1 -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=TK1UNIQUE1 \r\n, TENKTUP2 -- DERBY-PROPERTIES index=TK2UNIQUE1 \r\nwhere TENKTUP1.unique1 = TENKTUP2.unique1 \r\norder by TENKTUP1.unique1, TENKTUP2.unique1; \r\n\r\nFor the above query, as per the current trunk codeline, none of the order by columns are marked as always ordered because there is no constant comparison predicate on them. But, for the given join order, with TENKTUP1 as the outermost resultset and with the index TK1UNIQUE1, we know that the current row ordering at this point is going to ensure that rows from TENKTUP1 are ordered on UNIQUE1. Next, when we process TEKTUP2 in the 2nd join order position, we find that there is no constant predicate on TENKTUP2.unique1 and hence we conculde that the rows from TENKTUP2 are not going to be ordered and we decide to force a sort node on the top of the query. But in reality, even though the outer optimizable is not a single row resultset, it is ordered on TENKTUP1.unique1 and hence all those rows from outer optimizable are going to be ordered on TENKTUP1.unique1 and the inner optimizable has an equality join on \r\n\r\nTENKTUP1.unique1 using the order by column TENKTUP2.unique1 What that translates to is that even if there will be multiple scans into TENKTUP2, the rows qualified are going to be all ordered because of the equijoin between the outer and inner optimizables on the order by columns. So, with my latest patch, I have expanded the notion of always ordered columns to include both constant comparison predicates AND ordered column that has equijoin with an outer optimizable's ordered column. \r\n\r\nI think this patch is also improving the existing queries to include a better path than what it was picking up before. Following is an example of one such query from wisconsin.\r\nselect * from TENKTUP1, TENKTUP2 \r\nwhere TENKTUP1.unique1 = TENKTUP2.unique1 \r\nand TENKTUP2.unique1 < 100\r\norder by TENKTUP1.unique1; \r\nFor this query, the trunk currently decides to use TENKTUP1 as the outermost optimizable using the TK1UNIQUE1 index and then those rows are filtered using TENKTUP2.unique1 < 100. Each of the 2 tables involved in the query have 10000 rows each. So we are going through 10000 qualified indexed rows from TENKTUP1 and then applying TENKTUP2.unique1 < 100 on them. With the attached patch, we use TENKTUP2 as the outermost optimizable with the index TK2UNIQUE1 and only gets the indexed rows which satisfy TENKTUP2.unique1 < 100 and then on them, we use the equlity join to fetch qualified rows from TENKTUP1. \r\n\r\nI hope the above explanation helps understand the patch. I would appreciate if someone can take the time to go through the patch and provide any feedback they may have. If I don't hear anything by early next week, I will go ahead and commit the patch.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

I will plan on committing the patch tomorrow. \r\n\r\nOne piece of possible improvement that can be made to the patch in future is to hide all the information about the column ordering in the RowOrdering object. Currently, we check if the current Optimizable is a one-row resultset or not and if not, then the check to make sure that all the previous optimizables should be one-row resultset happens in OrderByList.sortRequired(this check is done if we have found earlier that there is no equijoin between the current optimizable's order by column with columns already ordered from the previous optimizables. This check is made much earlier in the optimization phase and the result of that check is encapsulated in RowOrdering object and so no code restructuring is needed for this equijoin part of the logic. The possible code improvement is for part of the logic where the current optimizable is multi-row, there is no equijoin on this current optimizable's order by columns so say that ordering already exists and the previous optimizables are not all one-row resultset. It may be possible for this piece of logic to be encapsulated somehow in RowOrdering object). I am not sure if this encapsulation is feasible or not but just wanted to note it in the jira.\r\n\r\nThis observation was also made by Mike and Army as comments to this jira entry,\r\n********************************************************\r\nA B added a comment - 20/May/09 10:17 AM \r\nmike> I thought it would be cleaner if all the information that was necessary \r\nmike> [...] was actually already located in the current RowOrdering object. \r\nmike> [...] The work here is that some more information may need to be tracked \r\nmike> in the RowOrdering. \r\n\r\nFor what little it's worth, I agree, I think this is a nice idea that would in fact be a \r\nbit cleaner.
