That regression test is attempting to create a JDBC batch containing as many batch elements as it can. I determined the number of batch elements to put into the test by experimenting with the Derby Network Client and with JCC 2.4, but apparently JCC 2.6 supports a smaller number of batch elements than JCC 2.4 did.\r\n\r\nDeepa is researching what the JCC 2.6 limit on number of elements in a batch is. Once we know that, we can change the DERBY-428 regression test routine in prepStmt.java so that it runs min(C, C24, C26) number of elements, where:\r\n - C is the number of elements supported by the Derby Network Client, which is 65534\r\n - C24 is the number of elements supported by the JCC 2.4 driver, which is 65532\r\n - C26 is the number of elements supported by the JCC 2.6 driver (which Deepa is researching).\r\n\r\n0x7FF is 2047 in decimal. It would be somewhat surprising if JCC 2.4 supported almost 64K batch elements in a single batch and JCC 2.6 reduced that to 2047, and it would certainly weaken the test to reduce the counter from 65532 down to 2047, but that may be the simplest solution. Since the original DERBY-428 bug only occurred when at least 9000 elements were in a single batch, setting the test limit down to 2047 would no longer test the original bug. If JCC 2.6 really supports only 2047 elements in a single batch, then we may want to enhance TestUtil so that we can tell whether we are running with JCC 2.4 or JCC 2.6, and then have the test use a different value depending on the driver in use, so that when we are running the test with the Derby Network Client we can still test that we support a large number of batch elements.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-03-25T06:26:58.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-25T06:26:58.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12330613/comment/12372148","id":"12372148","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"body":"Attaching a patch 'derby-1143.diff' which reduces the number of batch elements in the test derbynet/prepStmt.java so that it can run successfully with jcc2.6. \r\n\r\nI checked with the JCC folks who told me that JCC2.6 driver supports less than 32K batch elements.
