I ran the full repro on two machines on which I could reproduce the problem reliably without the fix, and now I don't see the exception. I don't see the deadlock that I saw with the previous patch either.\r\n\r\nThis fix factors out two for loops which iterate over moduleInstances into a helper method which synchronizes on the moduleInstances object over the entire loop. This prevents other threads from removing elements from the vector, and therefore the value returned by Vector.size() should still be valid when we call Vector.get(), and no AIOOBE should be thrown. I believe that it is safe, since the calls to size() and get() are already synchronized on the Vector, and the loop doesn't do anything except unsynchronized accessing a field in the object fetched from the Vector. So there should be no new ordering of how the synchronization locks are obtained, which was the problem with the previous patch.\r\n\r\nThere are still a couple of places where there's an unsynchronized window between the checking of the size and the actual retrieval from the Vector.

That should be harmless, though, since it should\r\nonly make the loop skip one of the modules or look at one of the\r\nmodules twice.\r\n\r\nIf one is skipped, the worst case would be if it was the module we\r\nwere looking for so that we boot a module unnecessarily, but this case\r\nis already handled by the method and it'll just shut down the module\r\nwhen it detects that it has been booted twice.\r\n\r\nIf one module is looked at twice, it'll just conclude twice that it's\r\nnot the module we're looking for and go on to the next one. (Since\r\nmodules are always added to the end of the Vector currently, I don't\r\nthink this will ever happen with the code as it is today.)\r\n\r\nThe patch does not introduce the possibility for any of those\r\nsituations by the way, they are just as likely without the patch.\r\n\r\nThe repro still runs without hangs or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions,\r\nand both Derbyall and suites.All ran cleanly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2009-06-29T15:14:16.161+0000","updated":"2009-06-29T15:14:16.161+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12412295/comment/12726108","id":"12726108","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed 2a with revision 790218.\r\n\r\nWill keep the issue open until the fixes have been back-ported to the 10.5 branch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2009-07-01T15:30:49.049+0000","updated":"2009-07-01T15:30:49.049+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12412295/comment/12726247","id":"12726247","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Merged to 10.5 and committed revision 790412.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2009-07-01T22:29:01.488+0000","updated":"2009-07-01T22:29:01.488+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-4018/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06qp3:"}}
