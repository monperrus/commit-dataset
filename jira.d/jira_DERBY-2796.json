That garbage, may be SSL-encoded communication or it might be something else. It is hard to give meaningful error-messages and it would require a major rewrite of the DRDA code, since this is detected way donw in the call stack. I think documentation is the proper solution here for the time being.\r\n\r\n2) The SSLException \"javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection?\" I think is ok, but it might be good to get rid of the stack trace.
