So\r\nthe property is still useful for that use-case.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't deprecate this (there is no compiler/runtime\r\nsupport for deprecating a random property?).  I guess we could remove\r\nsupport for it (in 2.2 or 2.1.1?) and throw an exception if we see\r\nthat the property is set (to catch users who had started using it) but\r\nthat seems rather harsh.\r\n\r\nSo ... I think we should in fact support it (but in the future we\r\nshould not add any more new System properties to Lucene, I think).\r\n\r\nI plan to modify Simple/NativeFSLockFactory to have no arg constructor\r\nthat sets their lockDir to null, and then add logic to\r\nFSDirectory.getDirectory to set its own dir as the lockDirName if it\r\nsees that the incoming LockFactory is one of these two instances with\r\na null lockDir.\r\n\r\nThe other 2 builtin LockFactory implementations already have no-arg\r\nconstructors so they work fine through this property.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2007-02-26T18:29:22.571+0000","updated":"2007-02-26T18:29:22.571+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363401/comment/12475975","id":"12475975","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Attached proposed patch.\r\n\r\nOK I made the no-argument constructors package-private since you would\r\nnot normally do this.
