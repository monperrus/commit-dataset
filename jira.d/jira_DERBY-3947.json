Pendleton","active":true},"body":"I fiddled with this problem for a little while, and I think that the\r\nproblem is that the index which is created behind-the-scenes to\r\nimplement the PRIMARY KEY constraint goes through a different\r\ncode path than the normal index which is created by CREATE INDEX.\r\n\r\nIn the case of\r\n\r\n  create table t (x varchar(1000));\r\n  create index t_ix on t(x);\r\n\r\nwe go through CreateIndexNode.makeConstantAction, where there\r\nis code that looks at the size of the columns in the index and notices\r\nthat we need a larger page size for this index, and chooses the\r\nlarger page size automatically.\r\n\r\nBut in the case from the issue description\r\n\r\n   create table t (x varchar(1000) primary key)\r\n\r\nwe *instead* go through TableElementNode.genIndexAction,\r\nwhich doesn't have any logic to notice that a larger page size is needed.\r\n\r\nI think that we could fix this problem by arranging for the colInfos data\r\nfrom the CreateTableNode to be passed through to TableElementNode.genIndexAction\r\nso that it can check the size of the columns and see if it needs to create the\r\nPRIMARY KEY index with a larger page size.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would be great if we could somehow share this code between\r\nCreateIndexNode and TableElementNode, but I think that the data\r\nstructures are unfortunately not very similar so we may end up\r\nwith two bits of code instead.\r\n\r\nAt least, I can *start* by writing a second bit of code and demonstrating\r\nthat it fixes the problem, and then we can try to figure out how to share\r\nthe code and only compute the index's needed page size once.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot
