I suspect there are some changes that need to be modified re: getting tests to pass But now that all tests pass, perhaps I can be a bit more discriminating in terms of what changes are really necessary.\r\n\r\nIn particular, SolrTestCaseJ4.copyTestSolrHome is a nocommit at this point. It's used once, but I'm thinking of leaving it in for the future as a handy method of copying all of a conf directory to a temp dir. It might replace a number of custom copy methods in various tests going forward.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erickerickson","name":"erickerickson","emailAddress":"erickerickson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erick Erickson","active":true},"created":"2013-08-24T22:40:28.041+0000","updated":"2013-08-24T22:40:28.041+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12647350/comment/13749724","id":"13749724","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erickerickson","name":"erickerickson","emailAddress":"erickerickson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erick Erickson","active":true},"body":"Re-worked it in light of lessons learned, it's cleaner now.\r\n\r\nI think it's ready to commit, all tests pass etc.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erickerickson","name":"erickerickson","emailAddress":"erickerickson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erick Erickson","active":true},"created":"2013-08-25T19:21:40.199+0000","updated":"2013-08-25T19:21:40.199+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12647350/comment/13749742","id":"13749742","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erickerickson","name":"erickerickson","emailAddress":"erickerickson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erick Erickson","active":true},"body":"Final version I think.
