It's some obscure  data format that tika can convert to plain text. I've never seen it, don't know what it is. Uwe filed a bug for Tika.\r\n\r\nLOL. It's obscure, indeed, especially for people outside the climate community. As representative of PANGAEA, I of course know this format (its something like a container for huge multi-dimensional arrays) of numeric data. The funny thing is: The only textual parts are metadata about the file in the header, the data itsself never contains any text. The UCAR netcdf library is on the other hand not able to handle streaming file input, so TIKA loads the whole file into memory... and OOMs in most cases for files I have seen (climate users produce files up to several gigabytes, if not terabytes, depends on use-case, see examples here: [Kleinen, T et al. (2011): Holocene carbon cycle dynamics, links to model files. doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.758219|http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.758219?format=html]). So I don't really see the use-case for support in Solr. But if we remove the JAR file, people who try to index .nc files, will get ClassNotFoundException. So ideally, we should also remove the file format from TIKA's META-INF in that case, or instruct the loader to ignore that. I always use some  \"TIKA loader\" component in my programs, that configure TIKA to only provide the formats I am interested in and I remove all useless JAR files then (but thats not easy). I can provide code how to configure TIKA for a subset of formats, which makes it easier for us to control what libraries are needed and users won't get ClassNotFound/InvalidClassFileFormat errors.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-03-30T07:05:43.686+0000","updated":"2012-03-30T07:05:43.686+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548740/comment/13242121","id":"13242121","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"body":"Climate format data?

Mattmann","active":true},"body":"Hi Guys:\r\n\r\nCouple of comments.\r\n\r\nbq. Thanks for doing the test. I know this already because I hit that, too. Its caused by TIKA's dependencies. The NetCDF (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) parser is only compiled with Java 1.6, although TIKA is also only Java 1.5, so this is a TIKA bug.\r\n\r\nIn Tika, I wouldn't classify this as a bug, since our parser jar dependencies can be excluded in various ways. It's simply a requirement for folks that are interested in all of the features that the NetCDF library provides, but if you don't care about parsing those types of files, you can simply omit that parser and exclude the jar file dependency.\r\n\r\nbq. 's obscure, indeed, especially for people outside the climate community. \r\n\r\nObscure? Sorry, not meaning to argue here, but that's pretty patently untrue. All data formats are at some level obscure, depending on the community that you work in. The \"climate\" one that you are talking about includes a broad range of folks, dealing with remote sensing, climate modeling, decision making, etc., at some of the highest levels of government, funding, and other areas, both in the U.S. and internationally. NetCDF, and HDF, OPeNDAP, and other formats are pretty broadly accepted standards. The use of data from NetCDF for example, resulted in over 2000+ publications generated as part of the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its 4th assessment report :) So, not sure it's obscure.\r\n\r\nbq. he UCAR netcdf library is on the other hand not able to handle streaming file input, so TIKA loads the whole file into memory\r\n\r\nYep, it's part of the issue of the underlying data file format more so than the actually library itself. It's because it doesn't support random access and yes the current code I had to bake into Tika unfortunately must work around it by loading the whole file into memory. Jukka and I have discussed some better support for this including temporary file support in Tika and we're working on improving it, but not there yet.\r\n\r\nbq. don't really see the use-case for support in Solr\r\n\r\nIt's up to you guys. If you want to tell users of Solr, \"hey you can drop a scientific data file format onto Solr and magically its metadata will be indexed\", then it might be important. We do this in OODT quite often, and it's one of the core use cases (and we even use Lucene and Solr for the metadata catalogs :) ).\r\n\r\nbq. Loading a 500 Megabyte file into memory just to get the header\r\n\r\nA lot of times that header contains the key parameters (spatial and temporal bounds) that are required to make a decision as to what to do with the file, as well as other met fields including the remote sensing variables, or climate variables being measured, valid units, links to publications, etc. So it's more than useless information.\r\n\r\nbq. Right, but how many people have these gigabyte climate data files\r\n\r\nDepends on who is using it. Like I said, this is pretty much all of the files that I deal with :), but to each their own. Disabling it in Solr isn't really going to affect me (or others much) since OODT pretty much does this anyways, but meh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chrismattmann","name":"chrismattmann","emailAddress":"chris dot mattmann at jpl dot nasa dot gov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chrismattmann&avatarId=15061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chrismattmann&avatarId=15061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chrismattmann&avatarId=15061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chrismattmann&avatarId=15061"},"displayName":"Chris A.
