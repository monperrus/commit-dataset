It simplifies the error handling and is smaller. It uses regexp (String.replaceFirst), which should be fine since this won't run on J2ME anyway. It can also be done without regexp.\r\n\r\nUnless someone thinks patch 1a has advantages over patch 2a, I plan to commit the latter. The one advantage I can imagine is if URL.toURI() is actually capable of correcting an invalid URL.\r\nAlso note that URL.getHost doesn't seem to work on a URL for \"\\\\myshare\\dir\\file.ext\", whereas URI.getHost does (after doing url.toURI()).\r\n\r\nPatch ready for review.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2012-08-21T10:53:14.662+0000","updated":"2012-08-21T10:53:14.662+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604192/comment/13460022","id":"13460022","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"marking normal urgency, and flagging patch available.\r\n\r\nKristian, do you still intend to commit patch 2a?\r\nI did a visual review and it looks good to me, but I've not actually tried any testing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2012-09-20T22:46:25.406+0000","updated":"2012-09-20T22:46:25.406+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604192/comment/13811128","id":"13811128","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"body":"Commit 1537862 from [~dyret] in branch 'code/trunk'\r\n[ https://svn.apache.org/r1537862 ]\r\n\r\nDERBY-5908: Fix incorrect URLs for network shares.
