We may add as a default that the chain ends in 404 in the 'unhandlable' case but that default fall through behavior should remain opened/overridable (multiple core spanning/joining requests could be handled in another filter for instance). \r\n\r\nIf we treat single core as multicore with only one core AND there is no default core:\r\nThe current test for what would be that \"single-core\" multicore situation looks like (multicore == null || multicore.isEnabled() == false); the ability to let users derive MultiCore (for serialization purpose at least) and  let them allocate it (through SolrDispatchFilter.initMultiCore()) should be kept (we are trying to avoid reintroducing a singleton here).\r\n If so & as is, this \"single-core\" multicore can not (should not be able to?) create new cores (nor can it swap cores since it can't create a new one) and probably should not attempt to read the multicore.properties (by-product of solr-646); this implies some new checks must be performed at the multicore level & dealing with a 'null' core name will still have to be considered & tested.\r\nThe risk - with my current understanding/knowledge - does not seem worth the (shallow) gain.\r\n\r\nBack to the issue description:\r\n\"MultiCore should require a core name in the URL; If the core name is missing, there should be a 404\": +1 as long as this can be changed (\"not a valid core\" is already out of the equation)\r\n\"...treat single core as multicore with only one core?
