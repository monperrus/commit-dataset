Maybe we should rename it to a new method to make it clear it \"waits for merges, commits, closes\", and then shift to the new semantics for close.\r\n\r\nIf we did this change, rollback() would discard changes since the last commit but NOT close.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2012-12-20T12:15:59.974+0000","updated":"2012-12-20T12:15:59.974+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599843/comment/13538011","id":"13538011","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"What I'm really dying for is just a close that is sure to close.

Miller","active":true},"body":"+1 on addressing this issue!\r\n\r\nCan I just point out that the 'proper' way to close an IndexWriter is perhaps:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n while (true) {\r\n      try {\r\n        super.close();\r\n      } catch (ThreadInterruptedException e) {\r\n        // don't allow interruption\r\n        continue;\r\n      } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        iw.rollback(); // mabye\r\n      }\r\n      break;\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nExcept we don't know if rollback is good enough there yet, and it's a little scary to have the while loop on the interrupted exception without a timeout. Writing a line of code to close the IW is an expert task if you want to get it right. If its currently possible to get it right.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps thats what you need for a safe close. How many people do you think are doing that? Can we agree that it's insane that you do have to do that? Have you ever seen anything like it?\r\n\r\nLet's come to some compromise on exactly what close does so that we can un crazify it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2012-12-22T16:28:28.857+0000","updated":"2012-12-22T16:28:28.857+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599843/comment/13538851","id":"13538851","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"Sorry - that's not even right for close - I forgot to put in an IW#unlock call a finally around this.

Uwe do you a pointer to the discussion?\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI am digging... I have no pointer at the moment, I just read blog posts and followed some mailing lists at that time, but that's now almost 2 years ago. The SQL stuff had more problems, which lead finally to the new interface AutoCloseable in Java 7 (java.io.Closeable extends java.lang.AutoCloseable). The reason is: SQLException does not extend IOException so the already existent java.io.Closeable was not applicable, so the new java.lang.Autocloseable was defined to throw any Exception subclass on its close() method, just java.io.Closeable limits this to IOException by subclassing. The try-with-resources magic in Java 7 only affects AUtocloseable, but as Closeable extends Autocloseable, it also applies to Closeable.\r\n\r\nUnless we move to Java 7 we are also limited to only throw IOException on close(), no other checked Exception. In Java 7 we could make IndexWriter implement AutoCloseable and let it throw any other Exception, too.\r\n\r\nOne important information about AutoCloseable from JavaDocs: \"Implementers of this interface are also strongly advised to not have the close method throw InterruptedException. This exception interacts with a thread's interrupted status, and runtime misbehavior is likely to occur if an InterruptedException is suppressed. More generally, if it would cause problems for an exception to be suppressed, the AutoCloseable.close method should not throw it. Note that unlike the close method of Closeable, this close method is not required to be idempotent. In other words, calling this close method more than once may have some visible side effect, unlike Closeable.close which is required to have no effect if called more than once. However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged to make their close methods idempotent.\"\r\n\r\nThis last sentence explains why java.sql.Connection is not required to be idempotent (see below). :-)\r\n\r\nbq. So I think another option here is to leave close as is (it waits for merges, commits) except, if an exception is thrown, it suppresses that exception, finishes closing, and then throws it. Like IOUtils.close.\r\n\r\nI am fine with that, only that it *must* record suppressed Exceptions (unfortunately the IOUtils in Lucene is in most cases used not in the optimal way, so the supressed exceptions get lost).\r\n\r\nbq. Hmm... does java.io.Closeable document semantics on exception? Ie if I call RAF.close and hit an exception, is it \"really closed\"? It does document that calling it more than once is fine ...\r\n\r\nIt says that you may call close() multiple times, but later calls mst be side-effect free, so after the first call to close it must be closed (otherwise later calls would have side-effects), although an IOException is thrown.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-12-24T11:46:09.802+0000","updated":"2012-12-24T11:46:09.802+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599843/comment/13539255","id":"13539255","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"{quote}\r\nShai objected to how verbose this is for \"normal\" usage, and I agree,\r\nso I proposed adding a sugar mehod \"commitAndClose\" that would just\r\ncall waitForMerges(), commit(), close().

When you call close, you should not silently lose changes -- you have to be explicit about losing them (rollback()) or committing them (commit()).

So if we:\r\n\r\n* Detect in close() that you have uncommitted changes or running merges and throw an exception\r\n* Let you separately call commit/rollback, waitForMerges/abortMerges and close\r\n* Add a sugar commitAndClose (which waits for merges? or takes a boolean?)\r\n\r\nThen I think we can make close() just close and releases resources, including the lock, at all costs (basically what was done just recently). We give existing apps a very easy migration path -- call commitAndClose(). And we let more expert apps to decide what to do about merges and pending changes separately from each other and closing the writer.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2014-04-02T15:44:53.426+0000","updated":"2014-04-02T15:44:53.426+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599843/comment/13957852","id":"13957852","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"bq.
