reasons: the standard analyzer used in that test is lower casing the query tokens, which have umlauts - and this fails, because the lower casing is done char by char (Character.lowercase). I think that the wrong definition of PREFIXTERM was masking this behavior before. I am not sure yet if this is a bug, but for testSimple to pass for now I would modify the test to use a non lowercasing analyzer when umlauts are present.
