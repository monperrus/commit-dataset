However from my experience with pax-exam tests the Thread.sleep() mechanism to wait for asynchronous services like blueprint to start up is always fragile and prone to break. You could set the sleep to a very large value (e.g. 30 seconds), however then your tests will take forever if you do that in any test.\r\nI have made good experience using a service tracker to wait for the service to come up (don't forget to set a timeout for that otherwise your test will never complete if the service fails to start).

Since this test hasn't failed for a while, it looks like upgrading pax-web did the trick. I do take your point about using a ServiceTracker. The next time I use pax-web in a test I will take the time to find out which services I can track in order to tell that the web container is fully initialised. Similarly if this test fails again, I will make the changes that you suggest.
