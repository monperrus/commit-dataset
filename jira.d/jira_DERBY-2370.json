I'm attaching a short writeup of the problem and a proposed solution as d2370_writeup_v1.patch.\r\n\r\nI'm also attaching a patch, d2370_engine_v1.patch, that implements the change by doing the following:\r\n\r\n  1. Adds the ability to mark a FromList as \"transparent\", and updates FromList.bindExpressions() to\r\n     pass the outer FROM list down (instead of \"this\") if the FromList is transparent.\r\n  2. Updates FromList.expandAll(...) to account for the fact that outer FROM tables might now appear\r\n     in a nested FromList (as a result of \"transparent\" FromLists; see code comments for details).\r\n  3. Modifies the \"setResultToBooleanTrue()\" signature to return a ResultSetNode (it was \"void\" previously).\r\n  4. Modifies ResultSetNode.setResultToBooleanTrue() to always return \"this\".\r\n  5. Modifies SetOperatorNode.setResultToBooleanTrue() so that it now creates an internal \"SELECT *\" query\r\n     whose FROM list contains just the SetOperatorNode. Then we transform the \"*\" for the new SELECT into\r\n     \"TRUE\" and leave the SetOperatorNode's result columns UN-transformed.  Finally, we mark the new\r\n     SelectNode's FromList as \"transparent\" and return the new SelectNode.\r\n\r\nI've included a corresponding patch, d2370_tests_v1.patch, that contains slight modifications to two tests: lang/union.sql and lang/ResultSetsFromPreparedStatementTest.  The latter changes are expected based on comments in the test; the former (lang/union.sql) has a couple of queries that now fail when they used to succeed.  However, I think the failures are correct--i.e. that Derby should have been failing prior to these changes and was not--so I've updated lang/union.sql accordingly.  I will send an email about this to derby-dev to see if I can get any feedback/suggestions around this.  And finally, d2370_tests_v1.patch creates a new JUnit test, lang/ExistsWithSetOpsTest, which captures and builds on the repro.sql script attached to this issue.\r\n\r\nI ran derbyall and suites.All with a single failure:\r\n\r\n   jdbcapi/parameterMetaDataJdbc30.java\r\n\r\nThis failure only occurred for the client framework and the diff showed a failure to connect--which doesn't seem related to my changes.  When I ran the test independently it passed as expected.  So I think it was just a fluke.\r\n\r\nReviews or other feedback would be greatly appreciated, as always.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2007-04-20T22:52:17.443+0000","updated":"2007-04-20T22:52:17.443+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363469/comment/12491606","id":"12491606","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dyret","name":"dyret","emailAddress":"Dyre dot Tjeldvoll at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dyre Tjeldvoll","active":true},"body":"I have looked at the writeup and and also looked at the\r\npatch.
