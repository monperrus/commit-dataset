Also the problems in Lucene 2.9 to make the new TokenStream API backwards compatible (the famous \"sophisticated backwards layer\") lead to enforcing finalness for this API using the decorator pattern. With this assertion we found lots of bugs even in Lucene code that were caused by overriding methods to change behaviour that should never be done in that way for decorator APIs.\r\n\r\nAnd this is NOT a HARD error. No production system is broken by that, as assertions are generally only enabled for testing. So the assertion failure simply tells your test system that you have to fix your code. In production without assertions, your code will still work. So where is the problem?\r\n\r\nIf you enable assertions on a production system you will see *significant* performance problems!!!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2011-09-07T21:08:14.184+0000","updated":"2011-09-07T21:08:14.184+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12521643/comment/13099566","id":"13099566","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Here a patch that the assertion status of the actual class is used.
