The TokenStream will call addAttribute(CustomAttribute.class) and the default attribute factory inside Lucene will then load the \"default\" implementation class \"CustomAttributeImpl\". This is done via reflection and Class.forName.\r\n\r\nIf the interface is defined in an own Classloader (like the interface and impl is put into the solr plugins folder), the interface itsself is loaded correctly (because instantiated by the plugin's tokenstream code). But the code inside AttributeSource then tries to load the Impl class with forName(attributeClassName + \"Impl\"). As forName per default uses the classloader from the calling class, this fails, because th classloader lucene was loaded with does not know the plugins folder.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the implementation class must be loaded with the same classloader as the interface Class<? extends Attribute> object passed into addAttribute().\r\n\r\nThats not a failure of Solr, but it the mechanism prevents putting own attribute impls into plugins of solr. They must be in the lib folder where lucene-core.jar is. By this patch it is more consistent and enforces, that the impl class comes from the same source as the base attribute.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot
