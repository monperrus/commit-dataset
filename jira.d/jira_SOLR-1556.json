Even if there is no clean way to ask for it, the scema supports what they want -- so we shouldn't error.\r\n\r\nI considerd breifly what it would take to make TVC support per-field overrides for the various options -- the trickiness comes from hte fact that it doesn't iterate over the list of fields itself.  It builds up a custom TermVectorMapper to pass to IndexReader.getTermFreqVector for each doc.  So we'd need to modify that TermVectorMapper impl to know about the SolrQueryRequest so it could check the options per field instead of just specifying the booleans when it's constructed.\r\n\r\nThings are also complicated by the fact that the tv.fl param defaults to the fl param -- so even if users enable termVectors, positions, and offsets for all the fields they care about, and they could starting getting errors if a new field is added to the \"fl\" when they *don't* care about any of that info.\r\n\r\nAll told: this may be one of the situations where an actual \"error\" isn't in hte best interests of the user -- adding a warning to the TVC output for each field/option combo that doesn't make sense is probably more useful.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2010-05-18T23:47:12.094+0000","updated":"2010-05-18T23:47:12.094+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12440535/comment/12872428","id":"12872428","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"Bulk updating 240 Solr issues to set the Fix Version to \"next\" per the process outlined in this email...\r\n\r\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201005.mbox/%3Calpine.DEB.1.10.1005251052040.24672@radix.cryptio.net%3E\r\n\r\nSelection criteria was \"Unresolved\" with a Fix Version of 1.5, 1.6, 3.1, or 4.0.  email notifications were suppressed.\r\n\r\nA unique token for finding these 240 issues in the future: hossversioncleanup20100527","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2010-05-27T22:05:04.855+0000","updated":"2010-05-27T22:05:04.855+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12440535/comment/12884878","id":"12884878","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"body":"Here's a patch, with tests, that fixes all the issues raised.
