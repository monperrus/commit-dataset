commented thusly in the solr forums (including a workaround):\n\nThe short answer is: right after you call \"stopFilter.init(args)\" call\n\"stopFilter.inform(solrCore.getSolrConfig().getResourceLoader());\"\n\nThis is an interesting use case that wasn't really considered when we\nswitched away from using hte SolrCore singlton and the the\nResourceLoaderAware interface was added.  we made sure things would still\nwork for people who had their own custom Analysis Factories, but some of\nthe functionality in *existing* Factories was moved from the init() method\nto inform() ... which means the classes aren't technically backwards\ncompatibly for people doing what you're doing: constructing them directly.\n\nWhen I have some more time, i'll spin up a thread on solr-dev to discuss\nwhat we should do about this -- n the mean time feel free to file a bug\nthat StopFilter isn't backwards compatible.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"20594","summary":"StopFilterFactory,
