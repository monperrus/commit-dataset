We can always add more os.arch values later as we discover new ones. Since os.arch is defined by the spec, I think it is a good thing to check it if sun.arch.data.model is not found or not accessible. Later, if this change doesn't cause any problems, should we also mention these properties in the documentation and put them in the default policy installed by the network server?\r\n\r\nOne small suggestion to make the code slightly simpler: The two loops in the checking of os.arch could be replaced by\r\n  if (Arrays.asList(b32).contains(arch)) return 4;\r\nand\r\n  if (Arrays.asList(b64).contains(arch)) return 8;\r\n\r\nAnd maybe the code to get the value of a system property could be moved into a separate method to save some code duplication.\r\n\r\nShould the THROWASSERT() be replaced with a DEBUG_PRINT() so that we don't prevent people from running the debug builds on platforms not used by the developers?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-07-23T11:46:18.638+0000","updated":"2008-07-23T11:46:18.638+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12398641/comment/12615981","id":"12615981","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Logged DERBY-3794 for the problems with some other estimates in ClassSize.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-07-23T12:03:55.744+0000","updated":"2008-07-23T12:03:55.744+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12398641/comment/12615999","id":"12615999","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Thanks for looking at the patch, Knut Anders.\r\nYour comments are all valid, I'll incorporate them in the next revision.\r\n\r\nI investigated a little more regarding the permissions.

That's why it is optional, and Derby has other mechanisms to determine the \"bitness\". The nice thing about the property is that it gives a definite answer if it is present (although it can be \"unknown\" I think). The logic for \"os.arch\" depends on knowing the architecture, and if an entry for a specific architecture hasn't been added, we can't conclude on the bitness. In these cases, the original heuristic will be used, which isn't working in all cases (i.e. Derby may use the wrong bitness, which affects size calculations).\r\n\r\nI know at least some versions of the IBM JVM use \"sun.arch.data.model\".
