On 3x, you just stop\r\nloading when we hit a termOrd > number of docs.  On trunk, we keep\r\nloading, simply growing the array as needed.\r\n\r\nI'm torn on what the best disposition here is.  This API should only\r\nbe used on single-token (per doc) fields, so this handling we're\r\nadding/fixing is about how to handle the misuse of the API.\r\n\r\nNeither solution is great -- throwing an exception is nasty since you\r\ncould be fine for some time and then only on indexing enough docs,\r\nperhaps well into production, trip the exception.  But then silently\r\npretending nothing is wrong is also not great because the app then has\r\nno clue.\r\n\r\nReally this'd be a great time to use a logging framework -- we'd drop\r\na error, and then not throw an exception.\r\n\r\nNet/net I think your solution (don't throw an exception) is the lesser\r\nevil at this time, so I think we should go with that.\r\n\r\nBut: I think we should also fix trunk?  Ie, if hit termOrd > numDocs,\r\nsilently break, instead of trying to grow the array.  Because now (on\r\ntrunk) if you try to load a DocTermsIndex on a large tokenized text\r\nfield in a large index you'll (try to) use insane amounts of memory...\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2010-06-19T09:08:43.433+0000","updated":"2010-06-19T09:08:43.433+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443006/comment/12882119","id":"12882119","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Committed in trunk, 3x, 3.0, 2.9 branches.\r\n\r\nTrunk is still missing the escape-branch when term count exceeds doc count.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2010-06-24T10:42:38.783+0000","updated":"2010-06-24T10:42:38.783+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443006/comment/12882129","id":"12882129","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Patch to fix trunk to stop loading when number of terms > maxDoc.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2010-06-24T11:10:22.370+0000","updated":"2010-06-24T11:10:22.370+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-2142/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04sm7:"}}
