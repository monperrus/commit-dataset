This causes the exception. On looking at the code, following is done to format DECIMAL types in LocalizedResource:\n\nif (type == Types.NUMERIC || type == Types.DECIMAL) { \n      return  getNumberAsString(rs.getBigDecimal(columnNumber, rsm.getScale(columnNumber)));\n}\n\nwhere getNumberAsString method does the following:\n\npublic String getNumberAsString(Object o){\n      if (enableLocalized){\n            return formatNumber.format(o, new StringBuffer(), new FieldPosition(0)).toString();\n      }\n      else {\n            return o.toString();\n      }\n }\n\nAs a solution, I am planning to do the following:\n1. Check for BigDecimal class in the JVM by doing a Class.forName\n2. Call getNumberAsString for NUMERIC and DECIMAL types only if BigDecimal class is available.
