The intent is to use only the nearest few neighbors.  This method has a long lineage in data-mining and the crux of it all is that \"nearest few\" part.  That is what allows it to express very complex relations by locally linear relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you really want to include all users, just compute the single average of all users off-line and be done with it.  This works because if you include any weighting by proximity, then  you can use a moderate number of neighbors and get the same result (i.e. the current behavior).  If your weighting does not strongly depend on distance as must be the case if all of the users are included in the sample, then you have a measure that does not depend on the user you are recommending for, that is, you have reinvented a \"most-popular\" recommendation.  If that is what you want, then you should use that and not a nearest neighbor recommender.\r\n\r\nEither way, I think that the current code isn't broken.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tdunning","name":"tdunning","emailAddress":"ted dot dunning at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Dunning","active":true},"created":"2010-08-05T06:51:11.608+0000","updated":"2010-08-05T06:51:11.608+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470868/comment/12895607","id":"12895607","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yanir","name":"yanir","emailAddress":"yanir dot seroussi at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yanir Seroussi","active":true},"body":"With all due respect, responding in such a condescending way is indeed quite rude and discouraging. I went through the trouble of opening an account and reporting this issue, which I still think is an issue, in order to help the developers. Making your clients/customers feel like idiots is not really the way to go. However, I will take the time to explain why I still think this is a problem.\r\n\r\nFirst, from an API design point of view, it is well-known that APIs should \"throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction\" (Effective Java, 2nd ed., Item 61). Since every method along the way is declared to throw TasteException (ignoring two other Effective Java guidelines: \"Avoid unnecessary use of checked exceptions\" -- item 59 and \"Favor the use of standard exceptions\" -- item 60, but never mind), it makes sense to throw exceptions that clients can understand without digging into the code.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is common practice to test neighbour-based collaborative filtering systems by varying the number of neighbours. For example, Herlocker et al (1999) (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=312682) experimented with neighbourhood sizes of up to 100, while Koren (2008) (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1401944) tested neighbourhood sizes of up to infinity, which is exactly what I was trying to do.\r\n\r\nI think that at the very least, NearestNUserNeighborhood's constructor could throw an IllegalArgumentException if n is larger than the number of users in the DataModel. This would make the API easier to use because the exception would come from the upper level, rather than from the depths of the implementation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yanir","name":"yanir","emailAddress":"yanir dot seroussi at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yanir Seroussi","active":true},"created":"2010-08-05T07:50:37.915+0000","updated":"2010-08-05T07:50:37.915+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470868/comment/12895719","id":"12895719","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tdunning","name":"tdunning","emailAddress":"ted dot dunning at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Dunning","active":true},"body":"I apologize for the tone of my remark.

If I change the constructors to rethrow the TasteException it will break backward compatibility, while catching the exception doesn't really make sense.\r\nOn a side note, I don't really see why DataModel.getNumUsers() is declared to throw TasteException, as none of its implementations throws this exception (as far as I can see), and I can't think of a case where a DataModel client will catch such an exception and do something useful with it, but I might be mistaken.\r\n\r\nSetting an arbitrary upper bound on n that is independent of the data model seems overly-restrictive to me, as any number we choose has no relation to the properties of the data model.
