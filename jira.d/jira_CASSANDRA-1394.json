Instead, they should bind to whatever hostname and /etc/hosts point at.  This makes it much easier to use a unified config across a cluster.  Also, yamlbeans doesn't respect the 'null' keyword, which should be the same as a blank value, but is instead treated as a literal string.  This makes programmatic generation of the config file difficult.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"92206","summary":"Blank listen_address/rpc_address no longer binds based on hostname","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandon.williams","name":"brandon.williams","emailAddress":"driftx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054"},"displayName":"Brandon Williams","active":true},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandon.williams","name":"brandon.williams","emailAddress":"driftx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054"},"displayName":"Brandon Williams","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"customfield_12311420":null,"customfield_12311421":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":2,"total":2,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12471650/comment/12898985","id":"12898985","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"reverted the yamlbeans switch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-08-16T16:49:15.240+0000","updated":"2010-08-16T16:49:15.240+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12471650/comment/12899390","id":"12899390","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","emailAddress":"jira at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true},"body":"Integrated in Cassandra #516 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Cassandra/516/])\r\n    revert switch to yamlbeans.  patch by jbellis;
