Would it be simpler to make close() synchronized (just like IR.close())\r\n\r\nIt would, but then it'd mean everyone who calls close() will wait, even if the TR is already closed. The code now is a nice way to only block threads which discover that TR is not already closed. I don't think it's that critical (how often do you call close() anyway), so I don't mind to keep it / make the entire method synchronized.\r\n\r\nbq. Would it - again - be simpler to keep maintaining the ref-counts in the internal IR\r\n\r\nI think that the code would look odd -- we'll ir.openIfChanged, then call incRef() until newIR.getRefCount() == oldIR.getRefCount(). And I'm not sure how will that play with someone calling concurrently to DTR.decRef() ... it might be a mess. Even though we duplicate ref counting logic, I think it's safer, but perhaps I misunderstood what you meant?\r\n\r\nbq.
