In the normal case where\r\nthe transaction finishes before the timeout, XATransactionState.xa_finalize()\r\nthen calls timeoutTask.cancel(). So far this so good. The problem, however, is\r\nthat java.util.TimerTask.cancel() does not actually remove the task from the\r\ntimer queue, meaning that a strong reference to the timeoutTask is kept (and\r\nthrough that to XATransactionState, the EmbedConnection, etc). The reference\r\nis not removed until the time at which the timeout would have fired, which can\r\nbe a long time. Under load this can quickly lead to an OOM situation.\r\n\r\nA simple fix is to call Timer.purge() every so often. While the javadocs talk\r\nabout purge() being rarely needed and that it's not extremely cheap, I've\r\nfound that calling it after every cancel() is the best approach, for several\r\nreasons: 1) the scenario here is that almost all tasks are cancelled, and\r\nhence this somewhat fits the Timer.purge() description of an \"application that\r\ncancels a large number of tasks\"; 2) there usually isn't a very large number\r\nof simultaneous transactions, and hence purge() is actually quite cheap; 3)\r\nthis ensures the strong reference is immediately removed, allowing the GC to\r\ndo a better job. Interestingly enough, I've had this exact same issue on a\r\ndifferent type of db, and I had tested the purge() there and found it to be in\r\nthe sub-microsecond range for 100 transactions (or similar - I don't recall\r\nthe exact data), i.e. completely negligible.\r\n\r\nIn short, my suggestion is to change xa_finalize as follows:\r\n\r\n    synchronized void xa_finalize() {\r\n        if (timeoutTask != null) {\r\n            timeoutTask.cancel();\r\n            Monitor.getMonitor().getTimerFactory().\r\n                    getCancellationTimer().purge();\r\n        }\r\n        isFinished = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs a temporary workaround, applications can do this themselves, i.e.\r\nadd something like the following whenever they close a Connection:\r\n\r\n  import org.apache.derby.iapi.services.monitor.Monitor;\r\n  Monitor.getMonitor().getTimerFactory().getCancellationTimer().purge();\r\n\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10365","value":"Crash","id":"10365"}],"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"36211","summary":"OOM
