The entire reliance on the coreNodeName is incorrect. Like I said, even if you had said users can't specify it and ignored back compat, it can't be in solr.xml then. Your code only worked because it is a user setting that is persisted in solr.xml.\r\n\r\nYour goal is fine, the implementation is all wrong.

So no way it should be in solr.xml. You can configure a new core in solr.xml and set a shard id and a collection - but now you are going to say you can't set some of those settings (coreNodeName), we are just storing them there internally and it's not for you to preconfigure or edit?
