All very good points.\r\n\r\nAttached is a slight revision to Peter's patch that does the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Adds the existence check for MAHOUT_JOB when looking in $MAHOUT_HOME/mahout-examples-*.job as Peter originally proposed.\r\n* Adds documentation for the -core option in the header\r\n* Adds MAHOUT_CORE environment as an alternative to the -core option\r\n* Instead of automatically falling back to local mode If MAHOUT_JOB is not set because the mahout-examples-*.job file can't be found when HADOOP_HOME and HADOOP_CONF_DIR are set, the script will error out indicating that the examples job can't be found with a helpful suggestion that 'mvn install' should be run. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, added the MAHOUT_LOCAL environment variable to force mahout to run in local mode although HADOOP_HOME and HADOOP_CONF_DIR are set. This is useful for developers to set in conjunction with MAHOUT_CORE\r\n\r\nI'll pause a bit to give the chance for people to review and then
