I am a new user to solr, but this seemed like a low-risk area where I could pitch in and help.\r\n\r\nThis proposed patch puts the relevant css information into regular css classes, and then adjusts the jsps to match, e.g. instead of \r\n   tr > td[name=\"highlight\"]:first-child\r\n\r\nyou have\r\n   td.highlight\r\n\r\nThe meanings are slightly different, and they apply to a broader range of HTML, but it improves the look in IE and did not seem to have any negative impact in Firefox 1.5.0.4.  I did not migrate every css2 selector over to a class this way, but just those that made a large difference in the way IE6 rendered the page without resorting to css hackery.\r\n\r\nIf I missed any locations, or their are awkward results in this style, feel free to comment.
