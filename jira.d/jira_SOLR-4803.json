This wouldn't have affected any upgraders though, and the new style solr.xml stuff has enough problems (you cant use the right data dir specification for solrcloud, core properties are not persisted - a problem for std Solr, broken SolrCloud, a lot of other little bugs) that I'd say you should not use it in 4.3 and I can't see how it will be solid until 4.4. There has already been a lot of work and there is a fair amount more to come, and it's enough churn to make a backport scary - I think the only way is forward.\r\n\r\nWhat prompted finding this issue with the smoke tests was shifting the example to use the new style so that we are forced to make it solid ASAP. I'll be contributing some more fixes shortly myself.\r\n\r\nSo this issue dones't really contribute to a 4.3.1 release IMO.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2013-05-09T20:30:00.593+0000","updated":"2013-05-09T20:30:00.593+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646706/comment/13653402","id":"13653402","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=janhoy","name":"janhoy","emailAddress":"jh at cominvent dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130"},"displayName":"Jan Høydahl","active":true},"body":"Agree that this would not bite people upgrading, so it's not urgent.
