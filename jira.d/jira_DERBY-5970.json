We should do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Prevent decryptDatabase from being set to an illegal value. Since this is a new attribute, there are no backward compatibility issues.\r\n\r\n2) Evaluate other attributes on a case-by-case basis to determine which ones should raise exceptions if they are set to illegal values.
