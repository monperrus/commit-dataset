Adding, say, half a minute to every run of the regression test suite to verify the fix of such a minor issue seems too much to be justified.\r\n\r\nc) The test case will have to interrupt the thread that is waiting for a connection. Each time we add a test case that interrupts a thread, we have to spend much time stabilizing the test suite afterwards because of strange failures that start popping up on some platform/JVM combinations.
