Man","active":true},"body":"This has popped up on the mailing list again recently, so i took a look...\r\n\r\nAs Shikhar noted, the particular exception is happening in a bit of dead code which is easy enough to remove -- but that's only part of hte problem.\r\n\r\nthe dead code is part of the tree walk of every ZK node that happens anytime you load the tree view page at all -- so having any non utf8 files anywhere in your ZK tree is going to cause that exception as soon as you try to look at the Solr ZK UI -- to reproduce just copy favicon.ico into your collection1/conf dir for example.\r\n\r\nbut even if we purge that dead code, a similar bit of logic exists in the function for fetching the details about a node if someone clicks on it.\r\n\r\nLooking through the history of the file, it seems like this problem was introduced back in r1298010 when the code was switched to use BytesRef -- the existing logic to hex escape anything that wasn't in unicode wasn't preserved  -- but from what i can tell, i don't think that ever worked (catching UnsupportedEncodingException from \"new String(byte[],String)\" doesn't seem right there according to the docs) and i'm not sure what use that would be anyway.\r\n\r\nIn the attached patch, i purged the dead code, added some error handling around the remaining attempt to serialize the \"data\" of any node the user clicks on, and in the event that the data can't be converted to String add a new \"dataNote\" property explaining why \"data\" is empty (even though dataLengh is non zero)\r\n\r\nIf no one sees any problems with this, i'll commit ASAP ... if we want to revist adding teh hex encoding output of bin conent we should probably hash that out in a new issue as an improvement, since i'm not convinced it's a good idea to just blindly do that in the same \"data\" field of the response ... could confuse people.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot
