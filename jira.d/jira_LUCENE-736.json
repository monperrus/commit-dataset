document A B C B A would score \"A B C\"~4 and \"C B A\"~4 the same. \r\nIt does that for \"B C\"~2 and \"C B\"~2.\r\nThis is because a general fix for that (at least the one that I devised) would be too expensive.\r\nAlthough this is an interesting case, I'd like to think it is not an important one.\r\n\r\nThis fix comes with a performance cost:  about 15% degradation in CPU activity of sloppy phrase scoring, as the attcahed perf logs show.\r\nHere is the summary of these tests:\r\n\r\n.......Operation..........runCnt...recsPerRun.....rec/s..elapsedSec\r\nOrig:..SearchSameRdr_3000......4.........3000.....216.1.......55.52\r\nNew:...SearchSameRdr_3000......4.........3000.....187.8.......63.91\r\n\r\nI think that in a real life scenario - real index, real documents, real queries - this extra CPU will be shaded by IO, but I also belive we should refrain from slowing down search, so, unhappy with this degradation (anyone would:-), I would look for a other ways to fix this - ideas are welcome.\r\n\r\nPerf test was done using the task benchmark framework (see issue 675), The logs show also the queries that were searched.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass with new code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at
