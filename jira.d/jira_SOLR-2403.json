With shards like\r\n{code}\r\nShard 1: A(1) B(1) C(1) D(1) E(1) F(9) G(1) H(1)\r\nShard 2: A(1) B(1) C(1) D(1) E(1) F(1) G(1) H(10)\r\n{code}\r\nand a request for mincount=10, all terms must be returned from both shards in order to get the result\r\n{code}\r\nF(10) H(11)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAs you, Yonik, point out, a variant of the problem exists when sorting on count. However, for count it is mitigated by the fact that the results from the individual shards are sorted by the selecting key (count). This means that the chance of missing or miscounting tags is low and can be lowered further by relatively little over-requesting.\r\n\r\nWith lexical sorting, the selecting key (count again) is independent of the sorting key. Over-requesting helps, but only linear to the fraction of the full result-set from each shard that is requested. Furthermore, the need for over-requesting grows with the number of shards as the overlapping hills can be smaller while still summing up to mincount.\r\n\r\nI do not have any real solution for the problem. One minor improvement would be a collector that kept collecting terms with a mincount=y until limit=n or the number of collected terms with mincount=x was equal to m, where x is the original mincount and y is dependent on the number of shards. This would at least stop the collection process when the result set was guaranteed to contain enough values above the given threshold. It would work well with spikes but poorly with hills just below mincount x and it would still not guarantee correctness of the sums of the counts, only correctness of the terms.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=toke","name":"toke","emailAddress":"te at ekot dot dk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=toke&avatarId=16760","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=toke&avatarId=16760","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=toke&avatarId=16760","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=toke&avatarId=16760"},"displayName":"Toke Eskildsen","active":true},"created":"2011-03-16T14:53:00.190+0000","updated":"2011-03-16T14:53:00.190+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12500480/comment/13007508","id":"13007508","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"bq.
