Here are some comments:\r\n\r\nTest case:\r\n$MAHOUT_HOME/bin/mahout seq2sparse --input text_output --output seq_output -Dk=v\r\n\r\nwhere \"text_output\" includes the output from \"seqdirectory\".\r\n\r\n- This fix works if I run a \"mahout\" from command line against a Hadoop cluster. A unit test case doesn't work; -Dkey=value is not parsed in ToolRunner but passed through to SparseVectorsFromSequenceFiles, resulting in a parse error. Did I make any mistake? Maybe because a JUnit doesn't really mimic a real hadoop env? I'm wondering if there is any unit test available that kicks off \"mahout\" from a command line rather than calling F.main(String[]) static method.\r\n\r\n- I was not sure about the convention of function parameter order, i.e., F(a,b,conf) or F(conf, a,b), but I just followed DictionaryVectorizer.createTermFrequencyVectors that places Configuration parameter after Paths. IMHO, Configuration should be the first or the the last arguments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=smtakeda","name":"smtakeda","emailAddress":"smakeda at gmail dot com-doesnotexist","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shige Takeda","active":true},"created":"2011-01-22T11:55:10.440+0000","updated":"2011-01-22T11:55:10.440+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12496328/comment/12986045","id":"12986045","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"body":"This looks pretty legitimate.
