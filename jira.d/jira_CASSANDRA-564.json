At this stage the node is removed from gossiper's own data structures (unreachableEndpoints), but not from token metadata. Currently token metadata is never cleaned up unless the node is decommissioned, should we do that at some point, too?\r\n\r\nAnother thing is: when a node enters the ring (that is, broadcasts STATE_NORMAL), there is no check in token metadata or storage service to prevent another IP from taking a token. Token metadata is simply updated with the new endpoint/token information. From this it would seem that another node can take the same token.\r\n\r\nFrom this it would seem that this improvement request is to decommission a dead node from the ring?

That is not very useful for a node that is already beyond repair, so simply broadcast STATE_LEFT to remove it from token metadata. The \"cleanest\" way would be to have separate state for this gossip, but that would add data to gossip just for this purpose, which is not very good option. Instead use STATE_LEFT with some small maneuvering in onChange.\r\n\r\nAttached two alternative patches for this issue with slightly different approach:\r\n\r\n564a: do not change current gossiping and just handle both normal leave and remove token commands in onChange.\r\n\r\n564b: modify STATE_LEFT to a tuple (REMOVE_TOKEN|LEFT_NORMALLY),<token>. This gives small extra amount of safety as onChange can make extra checks based on what is supposed to be going on. This approach overlaps slightly with the discussion on issue #572 with regard state gossip format.\r\n\r\nBoth patches include small tweak to STATE_NORMAL handling code as well.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jaakko","name":"jaakko","emailAddress":"rosvopaallikko at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jaakko Laine","active":true},"created":"2009-12-04T05:46:50.400+0000","updated":"2009-12-04T05:46:50.400+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441220/comment/12785775","id":"12785775","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jaakko","name":"jaakko","emailAddress":"rosvopaallikko at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jaakko Laine","active":true},"body":"fix wrong comment","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jaakko","name":"jaakko","emailAddress":"rosvopaallikko at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jaakko Laine","active":true},"created":"2009-12-04T05:55:14.630+0000","updated":"2009-12-04T05:55:14.630+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441220/comment/12785779","id":"12785779","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"ack, 3 versions?  which do you prefer? :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-12-04T06:06:02.098+0000","updated":"2009-12-04T06:06:02.098+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441220/comment/12785782","id":"12785782","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jaakko","name":"jaakko","emailAddress":"rosvopaallikko at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jaakko Laine","active":true},"body":"Difficult to say :)\r\n\r\nI think version b is \"cleaner\", but then again if we decide to go for single state gossip (#572), then STATE_LEFT would become already a 3-tuple (is it triple?).
