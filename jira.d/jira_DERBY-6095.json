A subsequent test run (triggered by a later checkin) appears to have run cleanly. The instability in the test lab needs to be addressed. I'm afraid I can't tell you when the lab will stabilize.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Rick\r\n******************************************\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.
