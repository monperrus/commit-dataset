This should handle the error seen in Oracle's regressions.\r\n\r\n- For Solaris/ZFS and similar file systems which support both Posix file attributes view and ACLs, don't touch the ACLs but stick to the Posix flags.\r\n\r\n For the latter my rationale is as follows: Principle of least surprise: most users never touch the ACLs but use the more familiar Posix file masks. It turned out the existing Derby implementation, although protecting the file adequately, showed a \"+\" in the ls(1) listing indicating that the settings could not be directly mapped onto the Posix model. The reason was that we removed more permissions than the plain read,write, and execute. Since ZFS internally builds on ACLs, the ls(1) listing would should that Derby had been tinkering with the non-mappable ACL permissions. I think it is better to stick to the Posix permissions by default. If people are using ACL functionality they are likely more than average concerned with security and can run with default file permissions and take full responsibility of the permissions fo created filed. Rationale end.\r\n\r\nRerunning regressions of NTFS, Solaris/ZFS and Linux. \r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
