Note that the query plans themselves are exactly the same--the only thing that's changed is the the qualifier ordering for one query.  This change of order occurs because as part of the costing code in FromBaseTable.estimateCost() the optimizer transfers predicates from one predicate list to another, gets an estimated cost, then puts the predicates back into the original list.  The methods to do this transferring are in NestedLoopJoinStrategy.java and HashJoinStrategy.java.  In the former, the predicates are transferred away in front-to-back order and then transferred back in back-to-front order, which leads to a reversal of the relevant predicate ordering.  Ex. If we have a list L1 of preds A,B,C and we transfer them to L2 in front-to-back order, L2 will end up with A,B,C.  Then, when we transfer the predicates back to L1, if we process L2 in back-to-front order, L1 will end up with C,B,A.  That said, with d1357_v1 applied the short-circuit logic prevents the optimizer from trying to optimize a join order that is known to be bad.  This means that we skip an unnecessary round of optimization and therefore skip one round of order reversal, which means the order of the predicate qualifiers in the final plan is now different.\r\n\r\nI ran derbyall on Red Hat with sane jars and ibm142, and saw no new failures.\r\n\r\nReview/commit would be appreciated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2006-07-08T00:50:24.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-08T00:50:24.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343690/comment/12421183","id":"12421183","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Hi Army,\r\n\r\nYour change looks very good to me.

The expectation is that the new (10.2) query plans will show improved performance over the old ones. \r\n\r\nCAUSE\r\n\r\nSince the optimizer is now spending less time evaluating sub-optimal join orders, it is possible that it will be able to try out more join orders before optimizer \"timeout\" occurs.  As a result the optimizer can sometimes find better plans than it did in earlier versions of Derby.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION \r\n\r\nThis was an intentional change to fix behavior that was not working correctly in earlier versions of Derby. The expectation is that the new behavior--and the subsequent query plans--will lead to improved performance over the old ones, so no further solution is required.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND\r\n\r\nThere is no way to disable/workaround this new behavior since the symptom as described above is a good one for Derby.\r\n\r\nThat said, any user who notices a negative performance change after moving to Derby 10.2, and who believes that the difference in performance is related to this optimizer change, is encouraged to visit the following \"performance diagnosis\" page and to follow up with his/her findings on the Derby mailing lists:\r\n\r\n\thttp://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/PerformanceDiagnosisTips\r\n\r\n<end_release_note>","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2006-07-18T20:24:51.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-18T20:24:51.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343690/comment/12422336","id":"12422336","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bandaram","name":"bandaram","emailAddress":"bandaram at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Satheesh Bandaram","active":true},"body":"Submitted this patch.
