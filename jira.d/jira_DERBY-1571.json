Instead of setting logWriter to null in shutdown(), logWriter is now set to an output stream that throws away all output. Since the stream is not null, the stack trace will be written to this stream instead of System.err. This way, all messages (including stack traces) are suppressed while shutdown() is running ping(), but we preserve the old behaviour with printing stack traces to System.err when logWriter is null.\r\n\r\nI have run derbyall and verified that the patch fixes the regression test failure.
