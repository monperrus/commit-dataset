The up-side is that we save one token per indexed point (~1/12th savings if 11 maxLevels).  The semantics of that '\\+' are intended to be that the entire grid cell represents an indexed shape for matching, so compare the rectangle for it with the query shape.  But for points, it should be the center point of the cell, so no '+'.\r\n\r\nIf a user doesn't re-index, then an indexed point is 1/2 the smallest grid cell closer to a query shape and as such might match when it didn't before.  Quite minor I think but worth mentioning.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2012-12-04T16:57:36.704+0000","updated":"2012-12-04T16:58:20.886+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618638/comment/13509912","id":"13509912","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"Updated patch with the correct set of files.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2012-12-04T18:06:27.018+0000","updated":"2012-12-04T18:06:27.018+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618638/comment/13510535","id":"13510535","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"I'll commit this tomorrow if there are no objections.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that didn't look at the patch, note that it adds an entry up in the API compatibility section:\r\n{quote}\r\n* LUCENE-4585: Spatial PrefixTree based Strategies (either TermQuery or\r\n  RecursivePrefix based) MAY want to re-index if used for point data.
