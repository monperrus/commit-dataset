I think we should apply the workaround and make the ignoreable whitespace significant. In my opinion this is not a problem at all, because the Analyzer will remove this stuff in any case, so some additional whitespace would disappear.\r\n\r\nbq. i did some experimenting and confirmed that the SolrContentHandler is getting ignorable whitespace SAX events for <br> tags in HTML â which makes no sense to me, so i've opened TIKA-1134 to try and get to the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nI know this bug and I was discussing about that since the early beginning in TIKA and I don't think it will change! TIKA uses ignorable whitespace for all text-only glue stuff, which was decided at the beginning of the project. I can find the mail from their lists; I was involved in that, too (because I applied some fixes for that to \"corectly produce\" ignorable whitespace in some parsers, which were missing to do this. I also added the XHTMLContentHandler stuff that makes \"block\" XHTML elements like <p/>, <div/> also emit a newline as ignoreable on the closing element, see TIKA-171).\r\n\r\nFYI: \"ignoreable whitespace\" is XML semantics only, in (X)HTML this does not exist (it is handled differently, but is never reported by HTML parsers), so the idea in TIKA is to \"reuse\" (its a bit \"incorrect\") the ignoreableWhitespace SAX event to report this \"added whitespace\". The rule that was choosen in TIKA is:\r\n- If you ignore all elements of HTML and only extract plain text, use the ignoreable whitespace. This is e.g. done by the TIKA's internal wrappers that produce plain text (TextOnlyContentHandler). They treat all ignoreable whitepsace as significant. Ignoreable whitespace is *only* produced by TIKA so if it exists, you know that it is coming from TIKA.\r\n- If you want to keep the XHTML structure and you \"understand\" block tags and <br/>, then you can ignore the ignorable whitespace.\r\n\r\nRegarding this guideline, your patch is correct and should be applied to solr.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-08-08T10:09:30.829+0000","updated":"2013-08-08T10:17:34.293+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12641032/comment/13733337","id":"13733337","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"The stuff with ignorableWhitespace was discussed between [~jukkaz] and me in TIKA-171.

So Jukka and I decided this would be the best.\r\n\r\nBecause you are still not convinced with my argumentation, let me recapitulate TIKA's problems:\r\n\r\n- TIKA decided to use XHTML as its output format to report the parsed documents to the consumer. This is nice, because it allows to preserve some of the formatting (like bold fonts, paragraphs,...) originating from the original document. Of course most of this formatting is lost, but you can still \"detect\" things like emphasized text. By choosing XHTML as output format, of course TIKA must use XHTML formatting for new lines and similar. So whenever a line break is needed, the TIKA pasrer emits a <br/> tag or places the \"paragraph\" (in a PDF) inside a <p/> element. As we all know, HTML ignores formatting like newlines, tabs,... (all are treated as one single whitespace, so means like this regreplace: {{s/\\s+/ /}}\r\n- On the other hand, TIKA wants to make it simple for people to extract the *plain text* contents. With the XHTML-only approach this would be hard for the consumer. Because to add the correct newlines, the consumer has to fully understand XHTML and detect block elements and replace them by \\n\r\n\r\nTo support both usages of TIKA the idea was to embed this information which is unimportant to HTML (as HTML ignores whitespaces completely) as ignorableWhitespace as \"convenience\" for the user. A fully compliant XHTML consumer would not parse the ignoreable stuff. As it understands HTML it would detect a <p> element as a block element and format the output.\r\n\r\nSolr unfortunately has some strange approach: It is mainly interested in the text only contents, so ideally when consuming the HTLL it could use {{WriteoutContentHandler(StringBuilder, BodyContentHandler(parserConmtentHandler)}}. In that case TIKA would do the right thing automatically: It would extract only text from the body element and would use the \"convenience whitespace\" to format the text in ASCII-ART-like way (using tabs, newlines,...) :-)\r\nSolr has a hybrid approach: It collects all into a content tag (which is similar to the above approcha), but the bug is that in contrast to TIKA's official WriteOutContentHandler it does not use the ignorable whitespace inserted for convenience. In addition TIKA also has a stack where it allows to process parts of the documents (like the title element or all <em> elements). In that case it has several StringBuilders in parallel that are populated with the contents. The problems are here too, but cannot be solved by using ignorable whitespace: e.g. one indexes only all <em> elements (which are inline HTML elements no block elements), there is no whitespace so all em elements would be glued together in the em field of your index... I just mention this, in my opinion the SolrContentHandler needs more work to \"correctly\" understand HTML and not just collect element names in a map!\r\n\r\nNow to your complaint: You proposed to report the newlines as real {{character()}} events - but this is not the right thing to do here. As I said, HTML does not know these characters, they are ignored. The \"formatting\" is done by the element names (like <p>, <div>, <table>). So the \"helper\" whitespace for text-only consumers should be inserted as ignorableWhitespace only, if we would add it to the real character data we would report things that every HTML parser (like nekohtml) would never report to the consumer. Nekohtml would also report this useless extra whitespace as ignorable.\r\n\r\nThe convenience here is that TIKA's XHTMLContentHandler used by all parsers is \"configured\" to help the text-only user, but don't hurt the HTML-only user. This differentiation is done by reporting the HTML element names (p, div, table, th, td, tr, abbr, em, strong,...) but also report the ASCII-ART-text-only content like TABs indide tables, newlines after block elements,... This is always done as ignorableWhitespace (for convenience), a real HTML parser must ignore it - and its correct to do this.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-08-08T18:02:16.617+0000","updated":"2013-08-08T18:02:16.617+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12641032/comment/13733791","id":"13733791","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"bq.
