Results are now consistent with IndexBasedSpellChecker.  An additional DSSC unit test is also added.\r\n\r\nI also changed the method name \"SpellingResult.add(Token token, int docFreq)\" to \"SpellingResult.addFrequency(Token token, int docFreq)\" .  This less-ambiguous method name should help prevent this kind of error in the future.  Note, however, if back-porting to 3.x, it might be wise to add back a deprecated \"SpellingResult.add(Token token, int docFreq)\" method.   This will prevent us from breaking anyone's custom solr spellcheckers...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdyer","name":"jdyer","emailAddress":"james
