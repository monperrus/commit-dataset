Ellis","active":true},"body":"So after the debugging session last night I think there are two uses for import / export: debugging, and actual data migration.\r\n\r\nFor debugging we want the raw view: unmerged sstables, the deletion times on CF and SC objects, and C.isdeleted boolean.\r\n\r\nFor migration we want removeDeleted to be called, and we want to be able to merge sstables into a single json stream in a sort of compaction.  Deletion information could be elided since anything we show will be undeleted.\r\n\r\nI no longer think we want raw data for cluster dump/load; if you're round-tripping through json for that, You're Doing It Wrong.\r\n\r\nSo for this ticket I think the minimum useful feature set is to support dump/load of raw sstables.  Later, we can add merge and cleaned-up-format for post-removeDeleted export.\r\n\r\nHow does that sound?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-11-25T16:14:26.919+0000","updated":"2009-11-25T16:14:26.919+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438587/comment/12783525","id":"12783525","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=urandom","name":"urandom","emailAddress":"eevans at opennms dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031"},"displayName":"Eric Evans","active":true},"body":"I went ahead and committed what I have so far, it spans the following changesets:\r\n\r\nhttps://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=885322\r\nhttps://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=885323\r\nhttps://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=885324\r\nhttps://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=885325\r\n\r\nThis includes an import utility w/ wrapper script (r885322) and its json dependency (r885323).
