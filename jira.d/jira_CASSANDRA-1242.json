A custom AbstractType defined against 0.6.x will be incompatible and the error messaging around why the comparator is invalid is obtuse and non-obvious.

message is:\r\n\r\nInvalidRequestException(why:instance)\r\n\r\nNo log messages are generated from the server as to the issue so the root cause is non obvious to developers.\r\n\r\nI marked as Major because types defined against 0.6.x did not require an \"instance\" field so at a minimum migration of AbstractTypes to 0.7 should document the change in what is expected of AbstractTypes.\r\n\r\nPatch attached for better logging and to create a more helpful exception for better communication to the client as to the
