Cloneable\r\n\r\n * InfoStream implements Cloneable (there is no need for this today but I assumed that some people might be interested to display line numbers or other things that would require adding a state to the InfoStream, I've no strong feeling about it and can remove it if you think it shouldn't implement Cloneable)\r\n\r\n * MergeSchedulers and IndexDeletionPolicies have been fixed so that clones don't share state with the instance they've been cloned from\r\n\r\n * IndexWriterConfig clones mergeScheduler and delPolicy (in addition to mergePolicy, flushPolicy and indexerThreadPool which were already cloned)\r\n\r\n * Most of the patch changes are due to the fact that many tests assumed that the IndexDeletionPolicy instance passed to IndexWriterConfig was the same one as the one used by IndexWriter (which is not true now since IndexWriter clones the provided config in its constructor and we now clone del policies in

Users cannot make a mistake, yet simple apps don't need to do weird things to get a handle to the objects they set on IWC.\r\n\r\nIf there are no objections, I will commit it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2013-07-26T12:54:50.398+0000","updated":"2013-07-26T12:54:50.398+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12638689/comment/13720806","id":"13720806","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jpountz","name":"jpountz","emailAddress":"jpountz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520"},"displayName":"Adrien Grand","active":true},"body":"The SetOnce<IndexWriter> on IWC addresses my main concern.
