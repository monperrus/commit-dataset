One thing I noticed: your $usage includes \"-V\" but doesn't mention \"-details\" - I'm guessing you renamed the option but didn't change the $usage?\r\n\r\nGood eye ... yeah, originally i named \"-details\" \"-Verbose\" but the way we are using GetOpt it does case insensitive short form args, so trying to use \"-v 4.3.1\" would error that -v was too vague (it didn't know if you wanted -verbose or -version) and i was too lazy to completely revamp the arg parsing to use something more sophisticated.\r\n\r\nbq. The way I've used that script, the question has been: Can I announce that the release is available? This is answered when all parts of the release are downloadable ...\r\n\r\nI hear you, and i have some ideas of how to make it work better for what you're describing, but it means gutting most of how poll-mirrors.pl works now, so i split that off into LUCENE-5108\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2013-07-12T18:22:45.518+0000","updated":"2013-07-12T18:22:45.518+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12657389/comment/13707207","id":"13707207","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"body":"bq. it means gutting most of how poll-mirrors.pl works now, so i split that off into LUCENE-5108\r\n\r\nThanks Hoss.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2013-07-12T18:27:04.341+0000","updated":"2013-07-12T18:27:04.341+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12657389/comment/13707214","id":"13707214","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"body":"Commit 1502646 from hossman@apache.org\r\n[ https://svn.apache.org/r1502646 ]\r\n\r\nLUCENE-5104: fix poll-mirrors.pl: a) use HEAD;
