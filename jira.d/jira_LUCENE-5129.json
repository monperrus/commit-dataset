The history behind this break is that in the past, category associations were indexed twice, with and without the association value. In the move to 4.2 I guess with all the transitions the code went through, this behavior was nuked (as it doesn't make sense in general to index these categories twice), but AssociationFacetFields has a comment that these categories are added anyway -- this is of course wrong.\r\n\r\nInstead of supporting null category associations, which is not so trivial in AssociationFacetFields, I think that we should just prevent it (throw a hard exception). If a user wants to add a category such as Category/Computer Science=0.74 (i.e. with weight 0.74) and be able to aggregate Category/ with and without associations, he should either write a special FacetsAggregator which ignores the associated value, or add the category twice, once using FacetFields (counting) and second time with AssociationFacetFields.\r\n\r\nI'll post a patch soon.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10120","value":"Patch Available","id":"10120"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"340064","summary":"CategoryAssociationsContainer should not allow null associations","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":5,"total":5,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12659552/comment/13718274","id":"13718274","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"Patch prevents setting a null association.
