Moving forward, it will not be the responsibility of the susbsystems implementation to generate such repositories. Rather, such repositories will be generated externally and registered as Repository services in the OSGi registry. Subsystems will then search these registered repositories in service ranking order during the provisioning process. Consequently, I will move this functionality to subsystem-itests since this repository is still necessary for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, I will keep the contents of org.apache.aries.subsystem.core.obr.felix in place, and subsystem-itests will import the contents. However, I wonder if even this should ultimately still reside in subsystem-core. This package contains a set of classes that essentially create a composite Repository around RepositoryAdmin. As part of setup, the test harness will need to generate the OBR XML based on the local Maven repository, register the XML with RepositoryAdmin, then register the RepositoryAdminRepository from the previously mentioned package as a Repository service with the framework.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"166256","summary":"Move generation of Maven repository from subsystem-core to subsystem-itests.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jwross%40us.ibm.com","name":"jwross@us.ibm.com","emailAddress":"jwross at us dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Ross","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jwross%40us.ibm.com","name":"jwross@us.ibm.com","emailAddress":"jwross at us dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Ross","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":0,"total":0,"comments":[]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ARIES-729/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0sthz:"}}
