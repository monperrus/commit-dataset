The change affects the communication between the mappers and their combiners and not between the combiners and reducer, so my earlier comment referred to a different interface. In this instance, the mapper records *can* be keyed by the canopyId alone, since they do share a common id-space. The current implementation passes the entire canopy - including its original center - as key but this information is not used when summing points for the centroid for output to the reducer. The key is only used to correlate the various points during copy/sort prior to the summing process and is not actually used within it.\r\n\r\nI think Edward's patch represents a small performance improvement, in that shorter keys would presumably be faster than longer ones.\r\n\r\n+1\r\nJeff","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeastman","name":"jeastman","emailAddress":"jeff at windwardsolutions dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232"},"displayName":"Jeff Eastman","active":true},"created":"2008-10-17T16:14:40.648+0000","updated":"2008-10-17T16:14:40.648+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406366/comment/12640620","id":"12640620","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeastman","name":"jeastman","emailAddress":"jeff at windwardsolutions dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232"},"displayName":"Jeff Eastman","active":true},"body":"r705676 committed the change.
