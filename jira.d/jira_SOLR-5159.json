I want to verify Maven2 locally, and I also want to compare all manifest entries with the Ant-produced ones - the solr entries were changed recently, and I want to keep them in sync.\r\n\r\nMaven 2.2.1 works fine.\r\n\r\nI compared the Ant-built and Maven-built manifests, and the Maven-built ones of course have lots of Bnd-produced entries not in the Ant-built ones.  There are two other differences:\r\n\r\n# The Maven-built manifest contains Implementation-Vendor-Id (with Maven coordinate groupId as the value: org.apache.lucene or org.apache.solr).  I think this is fine to leave in, and maybe the Ant-built manifests should get it too?\r\n# The Maven-built manifests have the old style {{Specification-Version}}, including a timestamp, e.g. {{5.0.0.2013.08.16.12.36.14}}, where the Ant-built manifests just have the version, e.g. {{5.0-SNAPSHOT}}.  The latter is actually syntactically incorrect, since the value should only have digits and period.  I've left it as the old style in the Maven version, since it's not a syntax error, and since the Maven versions will only ever be produced by end-users - all snapshot and release Maven artifacts are produced by Ant.\r\n\r\nI've committed to trunk and branch_4x.\r\n\r\nThanks Artem!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2013-08-16T17:56:34.875+0000","updated":"2013-08-16T17:56:34.875+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663863/comment/13742480","id":"13742480","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artem.karpenko","name":"artem.karpenko","emailAddress":"gooyozh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Artem Karpenko","active":true},"body":"Great, thank you Steve, I was glad to help.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artem.karpenko","name":"artem.karpenko","emailAddress":"gooyozh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Artem Karpenko","active":true},"created":"2013-08-16T18:13:02.758+0000","updated":"2013-08-16T18:13:02.758+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663863/comment/13787067","id":"13787067","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jpountz","name":"jpountz","emailAddress":"jpountz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520"},"displayName":"Adrien Grand","active":true},"body":"4.5 release -> bulk close","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jpountz","name":"jpountz","emailAddress":"jpountz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jpountz&avatarId=16520"},"displayName":"Adrien Grand","active":true},"created":"2013-10-05T10:19:02.698+0000","updated":"2013-10-05T10:19:02.698+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-5159/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1natj:"}}
