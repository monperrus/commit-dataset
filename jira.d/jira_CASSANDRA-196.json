This also allows us to make the columngroup fetching more efficient in the best case (deserializing one column at a time instead of a group at a time).\r\n\r\nOTOH using one index to allow fetching items relatively efficiently in either directly is cool.  But my gut says it's relatively uncommon to want to access in both directions at once, and even more uncommon to not be able to do a reverse() on the client side (because of data volume, for instance).  Forcing a separate CF for this special case of a special case might be worth the
