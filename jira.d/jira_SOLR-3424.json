I think the chain of Try...Catch with ClassNoFound should be changed to do it more smart: If the name of encoder contains a period (indexOf('.')>=0), look it up as class name, otherwise prefix it with the commons package name. This way, the JVM cache for loaded classes can be used and the cache is completely useless.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like in your fix, that it also changed the broken uppercasing: It should only do that for the builtins, class names itsself are case sensitive.\r\n\r\n+1 to remove the cache and only keep the static builtins (and please: as Collections.unmodifiableMap!!!), lookup non-builtins without try...catch(ClassNotFound).

I wasn't sure what the lifecycle of this class was or if/how it is shared; I looked at the javadocs of TokenFilterFactory just now and I think its clearer.  Given that the Factory's init() method is not going to be called frequently, it seems to me that the class name based lookups need not cache at all.  And I also like your suggestion of improving the fallback lookup by looking for a '.'.  BTW I considered wrapping with unmodifiableMap but didn't bother because it's not exposed outside of this class, which is fairly small too, but I will since it seems to be a big deal to you (three exclamation points).

In Lucene 4.0, reuse of TokenStreams is *enforced* so there is no cost at all by the reflection and the createInstance. I also improved the reflective method call (which has the side effect of being able to print a useful message when the encoder does not support setMaxLen, the old code throwed unspecified and unhelpful Exception).\r\n\r\nIn general, the commons encoders might be thread safe, but we use reflection and use any class the user provides and other classes implementing the abstract Encoder interface may not be thread safe (unless this is explicitely specified in their spec / javadocs - which isn't)\r\n\r\nAs it costs us nothing (Class.newInstance() is cheap and only called once a new thread is used and the SolrAnalyzer class has to create new TokenStreamComponents), we should stay with the current code. The thread-safety is then ensured by the Analyzer class (it uses thread-locals to reuse TokenStreams).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about my latest patch?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-05-03T07:26:10.348+0000","updated":"2012-05-03T07:27:15.669+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12553307/comment/13268053","id":"13268053","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"Looks good Uwe.\r\nOne minor nit is that the URL in the class Javadoc to Commons-Codec's Language package should be this URL:\r\nhttp://commons.apache.org/codec/apidocs/org/apache/commons/codec/language/package-summary.html   which is the one to 1.6; the existing link is older with fewer classes.
