I think that if the client receives a chain of exceptions, it should call SQLCAMESSAGE once for each exception in the chain and rebuild the exception chain as it was on the server.\r\n\r\nThe logic in Sqlca.processSqlErrmcTokens() on the client seems to be broken. It tries to split an SQLERRMC message into tokens, but it uses a different token delimiter than the server (server uses \\u0014, client uses \\u00FF). Therefore, the client always thinks it gets one big token from the server. This doesn't seem to be a big problem, since it would anyway just split it into separate tokens and concatenate the tokens again, but it seems a little strange. If we want the client to split the SQLERRMC into a chain of exceptions, this has to be fixed though.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2007-05-25T07:14:28.708+0000","updated":"2007-05-25T07:14:28.708+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12370202/comment/12500123","id":"12500123","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attaching a patch which makes the client recreate the chain of\r\nexceptions sent by the server instead of concatenating the messages.\r\n\r\nDerbyall and suites.All ran cleanly on JDK5 and JDK6.\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes:\r\n\r\n* java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Sqlca.java:\r\n\r\n  -
