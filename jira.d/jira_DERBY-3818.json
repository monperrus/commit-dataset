We fetch the Clob piece by piece. Again we're hit by the problem I tried to solve with DERBY-3769.\r\nThe limit for what we can transfer in one go is not 32672 characters, it seems to be 32672 bytes. So Derby ends up advancing the stream too far, and has to reset the stream and skip the data until correctly positioned again. Probably we obtain a substring of 32672 characters, call String.getBytes(UTF8) and then selects the first 32672 bytes of the resulting byte array. The rest is discarded.\r\nData is going over the line as UTF-8.\r\n\r\nThe next problem hit is the naive repositioning algorithm, which we cannot avoid by adjusting the buffer size. This is the same issue as for Blob (DERBY-3766). I'll log a Jira for this, and maybe upload a patch for review before I go on vacation.\r\n\r\nI haven't spent a lot of time investigating this, but a simple experiment (with some other unfinished code as well) brought the time on my machine down to 60 seconds, running both the embedded and the client suite.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2008-08-05T16:02:25.226+0000","updated":"2008-08-05T16:02:25.226+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401696/comment/12643507","id":"12643507","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Patch 1a enables the client test.\r\n\r\nThe poor performance has been resolved by other patches, most probably DERBY-3825 and DERBY-3769.\r\nFor me, MultiByteClobTest takes a little less than 1 minute with embedded only and around 2 minutes with both embedded and client tests.\r\nI plan to commit the patch tomorrow.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2008-10-29T14:54:49.405+0000","updated":"2008-10-29T14:54:49.405+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401696/comment/12643797","id":"12643797","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Committed patch 1a to trunk with revision 709132.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2008-10-30T10:13:14.235+0000","updated":"2008-10-30T10:13:14.235+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-3818/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0705b:"}}
