It did fix an exception during startup (solrconfig.xml couldn't be found) when I followed your simple instructions for running the multicore example with discovery, but only core0 started, core1 didn't, because it had the same dataDir as core0.\r\n\r\n[~markrmiller@gmail.com] - Do you happen to know how we can fix the problem with relative or missing dataDir properties in the 4.3 branch?
