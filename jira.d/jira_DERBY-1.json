Grace","active":true},"body":"This issue has been discussed on derby-dev including a patch which works on OSX and (I believe) should work elsewhere as well.  The relevant (thread and) post is:\r\n\r\nhttp://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=derby-dev@db.apache.org&msgNo=233\r\n\r\nIt actually includes a fix for another (I suspect) bug as well.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the fix is to change the write mode from \"rws\" (which causes an issue on OSX) to the less strenuous \"rwd\".  The difference is that \"rws\" keeps metadata synchronously (as well as data) whereas \"rwd\" just does the data (and only the metadata _necessary_ to ensure the data is recoverable).  IOW, it's quite possible that \"rwd\" is the preferred mode for a high performance database.\r\n\r\nAs for why \"rws\" has issues on OSX, the issue was unresolved as there are ambiguities in what OSX is doing, and what exactly \"rws\" should do under certain circumstances.  The interesting circumstance in this case is that a data file exists yet (presumably?) associated metadata files do not exist, possibly leading to the error.  That's my take on it anyway.  I have not had time to track it further, but it works with the patch on OSX.\r\n\r\n-=-\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the process is to approve or disapprove my proposed patch.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=occam","name":"occam","emailAddress":"joccam at mac dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joseph Grace","active":true},"created":"2004-09-24T23:01:59.000+0000","updated":"2004-09-24T23:01:59.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/27458/comment/53406","id":"53406","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hlavac","name":"hlavac","emailAddress":"hlavac at code dot cz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jan Hlavatý","active":true},"body":"Let me warn you though - we got suspiciously high throughput when using \"rwd\", so we suspect it may not do what it is supposed to do, and crash recovery may not work as good as expected.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hlavac","name":"hlavac","emailAddress":"hlavac at code dot cz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jan Hlavatý","active":true},"created":"2004-09-24T23:46:57.000+0000","updated":"2004-09-24T23:46:57.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/27458/comment/53411","id":"53411","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tsantos","name":"tsantos","emailAddress":"tomsdepot-apache at yahoo dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom Santos","active":true},"body":"The \"rwd\" patch got it working for me.

Current system has a flag to disable write sync and use file sync to make sure logs are written to disk on commit. \r\n \r\nWrite sync mode can be disabled by setting  \"derby.storage.fileSyncTransactionLog=true\" in derby.properties. When this property is set  to true  logging system does  file syncs on commits  similar to what happens on jvms before jdk142.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy two cents on the patch:\r\nAs Jan mentioned before , I also don't believe \"rwd\" mode is doing sync writes on MAC OS. If syncs does not occur, users can have unrecoverable databases or lost data. Until Apple fixes \"rws/rwd\" bug.It would be safer for  users to use derby.storage.fileSyncTransactionLog  or have another PATCH that will identify MAC OS and make logging system use file sync until JVM bug is fixed. \r\n\r\nAlthough using \"rwd\" may provide better performance on some OS. I don't think it is safe to fix this problem. \r\n\r\nHaving OS specific checks is not a clean solution, but I can not think of any other alternative way to fix this problem.
