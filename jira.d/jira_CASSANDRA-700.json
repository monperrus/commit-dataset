It does so in a variety of ways, some of which are attempts at being thread-safe (with mixed results) while others seem to just delay instantiation.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track the changes necessary to consolidate these many forms of singleton into one form. \r\n\r\nWhat's interesting is that Java has a nice way of providing this facility in a very Java-y way.  We can create a public static variable (called, say, instance) and, in the class definition, set it to a new instance of the very class we are in. We then can protect the class's constructor to prevent others from trying to use it. This allows us to have only one instance of the variable accessible only through the a static variable on the class itself.\r\n\r\nThis is thread-safe because class definitions in Java is thread-safe. This is lazily loaded because Java doesn't do class definition until the first time the class is referenced in any way. Basically, this is everything that was attempted with the various static instance() methods but with complete success.\r\n\r\nThe current classes I was able to find that can benefit from this are:\r\n\r\nAntiEntropyService\r\nFailureDetector\r\nGossiper\r\nHintedHandOffManager\r\nMessagingService\r\nReadRepairManager\r\nStorageLoadBalancer\r\nStorageService\r\n\r\nOther classes with similar constructions would be nice to remove, too.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12430246","id":"12430246","filename":"0001-MessagingService.instance-MessagingService.instance.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jmhodges","name":"jmhodges","emailAddress":"jeff

There is a significant amount of work that goes on in the constructor that was executed by instance() if shutdown() had been called previously.\r\n\r\nOne approach would be to replace shutdown() with a reset() that does what shutdown() does now but takes the additional step of re-initializing things (the work done in the constructor). Kind of lame, but it would make the code functionally similar to the way it was before the patch.\r\n\r\nBut then again, it might be wasted work since other services limit how reentrant cassandra can be overall. Perhaps a better approach would be to state unequivocally that the cassandra services *are not* reentrant and make sure that Bad Things happen if MessagingService is used after it's shutdown() has been called.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gdusbabek","name":"gdusbabek","emailAddress":"gdusbabek at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070"},"displayName":"Gary Dusbabek","active":true},"created":"2010-01-14T14:48:11.542+0000","updated":"2010-01-14T14:48:11.542+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12445502/comment/12800221","id":"12800221","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jaakko","name":"jaakko","emailAddress":"rosvopaallikko at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jaakko Laine","active":true},"body":"Are you sure it's lazy & safe?
