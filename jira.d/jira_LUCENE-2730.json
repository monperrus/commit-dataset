I'll also remove this from trunk and 3.x.\r\n\r\nTestAtomicUpdate's deadlock only happens when autoCommit=true, when one thread has called commit and the flush by that commit tries to spawn new merges, which enters CMS who then hits the max merge thread count and waits for merge threads to finish while another merge thread is attempting an autoCommit.  I don't think we need to make any changes to 3.x/trunk for this (autoCommit is gone).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2010-10-30T14:30:13.337+0000","updated":"2010-10-30T14:30:13.337+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12478721/comment/12926584","id":"12926584","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"It's there since the very beginning of 2.9/3.0.
