I agree result set reuse is the problem here.\r\n\r\nThere are at least two JoinResultSets here (1 and 2 below) that are marked as open, even when the parent ProjectRestrictResultSet is not so marked (since openCore failed with the timeout).\r\n\r\nSo, at reuse time, the top level ProjectRestrictResult skips closing the underlying JoinResultSet structure, because it itself is not marked opened. The patch works around this by cleaning up children if openCore fails, effectively undoing the setting of the isOpen flag.\r\n\r\n1) The top JoinResultSet's openCore sets its isOpened flag *before* it attempts to open the children result sets. This triggers the seen error when the result set is reused (opened again).\r\n2) Even if that is fixed by moving the setting of isOpened to the end of the method, there is another problem:  A lower level left result set does open correctly, but right child result set in a join fails with the timeout. The left one is thus already open at reuse openCore time. So just moving the flag setting is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.

However, can you see a scenario where an\r\nerror at close time would be retryable (like time-out at open time) ?\r\n\r\nAs the code in the patch currently stands, it does not check if the\r\nexception is a a retryable one, admitted, it just goes ahead and\r\ncloses the child result set(s).
