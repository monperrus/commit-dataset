The customer experiencing the failure has continued to test with your patch (in 11 builds to date) and has only observed the NPE failure once (on 3/12/08).  The failure rate prior to this change was 35% (a failure approximately every 3 builds).  Your patch, if not correcting the problem, has at least greatly reduced the frequency with which it happens.  I will post to this issue should another build encounter the NPE problem.  If there are no further occurrences I think it is safe to say that the failure reported on 3/12 was an anomaly.   \r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stan","name":"stan","emailAddress":"Stan dot Bradbury at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stan Bradbury","active":true},"created":"2008-03-19T22:56:20.231+0000","updated":"2008-03-19T22:56:20.231+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12390470/comment/12580606","id":"12580606","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"OK then, I will go ahead and commit it, but I fear it will only make the problem more elusive and hard to reproduce.
