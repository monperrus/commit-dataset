Some answers to your questions follow:\r\n\r\n1) No checking has been made to ensure that the Integer won't truncate silently when it is stuffed into the Short. I can run some experiments to see what happens when you try to send a large int across the network for use by a SMALLINT INOUT arg.\r\n\r\n2) Cursor.getObject() can raise SqlException. But if it does that probably indicates a bug--it is returning what java.sql.CallableStatement.getObject() is supposed to return. I could narrow that catch down to just filter out SqlExceptions. StatementCallbackInterface.completeExecuteCall() raises no errors and its callers perform no error handling other than to relay DisconnectExceptions up the call stack.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Rick","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2011-03-30T12:57:41.210+0000","updated":"2011-03-30T12:57:41.210+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366428/comment/13013940","id":"13013940","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the explanations, Rick.\r\n\r\n1) I asked because I wasn't sure if the Integer objects originated from user input.

And adding a new checked exception type to the throws clause is a bit awkward here, I agree, at least when it's just to handle a case that's not supposed to happen. Narrowing it down to SqlException only, and possibly also making the try block smaller so that it only encloses the expression that may raise the exception, sounds like a good improvement. For extra bonus, you might want to call initCause() on the wrapper to preserve the stack trace if this is ever going to happen.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2011-03-31T12:07:22.880+0000","updated":"2011-03-31T12:07:22.880+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366428/comment/13014028","id":"13014028","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Attaching derby-2515-02-aa-polishCatchBlock.diff, which incorporates Knut's excellent suggestions.
