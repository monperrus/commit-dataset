It's only because of your stack trace that i was able to understand his comment about overriding getSolrHome() and how my change introducing TEST_KEYSTORE introduced a problem for people subclassing SolrjettyTestBase in their external tests.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a patch that i think resolves this issue.  SolrJettyTestBase now skips the SSL randomization logic (instead of a hard fail) if the example configs can't be found, and i also tried to improve ExternalPaths.SOURCE_HOME (and determineSourceHome()) have cleaner behavior in the event that they get used inadvertently by a client test.\r\n\r\nI experimenting with this changes in a little one off external test i created and it seemed to work, but i'd appreciate feedback from an end user who got burned by this bug to e sure it really resolves things for you.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2013-05-30T01:20:32.198+0000","updated":"2013-05-30T01:20:32.198+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12649043/comment/13673236","id":"13673236","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jgibson","name":"jgibson","emailAddress":"john at losgibsons dot us","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Gibson","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the patch Hoss Man.
