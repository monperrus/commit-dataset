subQuery, because an arbitrary function will be executed on that score that might not adhere to the distributive law.\r\n\r\nSo if someone has a BooleanQuery(CustomScoreQuery(TermQuery)))^5, but their CustomScoreProvider scores with log(subQueryScore) + valSrcScore, they might wonder what happened to their boost of 5 on the outer booleanquery.\r\n\r\nThis is more of a corner case, but i think it
