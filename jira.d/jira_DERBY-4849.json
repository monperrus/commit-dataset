Some comments on the patch:\r\n\r\nThe name of the flag and the method may cause some confusion. The flag is set if the execution failed because the plan was invalidated. The plan has not necessarily been recompiled at that time, and the recompiling may in fact be performed by the same thread after processing the exception, if no other thread beats it to it. So perhaps rename to planWasInvalidated?\r\n\r\nI'm wondering, though, what's the intended behaviour when the execution fails for some other reason? Currently we add rows into SYSXPLAIN_STATEMENTS regardless of the statement's successful execution, but should we have been suppressing all failed executions? If so, we could set the flag unconditionally in cleanupOnError(). But that may be outside the scope of this issue, unless it's obvious that the current behaviour is unintended.\r\n\r\nDo we know for sure that StandardException.getMessageId() will never return null? Probably... But just to be 100% that we don't cause a NPE in the error handling, should we turn around message id check in cleanupOnError() and call equals() on LANG_STATEMENT_NEEDS_RECOMPILE, which is known to be non-null?\r\n\r\nThe comment in cleanupOnError() has a small typo: s/optimalization/optimization/","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-10-18T21:33:04.132+0000","updated":"2010-10-18T21:33:04.132+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12477327/comment/12922434","id":"12922434","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Perhaps the method name could be getStatementNeedsRecompile()?

It may work if the transaction releases the locks before retrying, but I think syscs_update_statistics does all its work in the user transaction, and we need to use nested transactions if we want to release exclusive locks in the middle of a user transaction.

Note that the approach with nested transactions with NO_WAIT and retry in the parent transaction is first and foremost used to resolve self-deadlocks (lock conflicts between a nested tx and its parent tx). In this test, the deadlock involves multiple transactions, and even if a retry may resolve a deadlock, it is still possible that the retry in the parent transaction runs into a similar deadlock.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-11-02T11:02:57.059+0000","updated":"2010-11-02T11:02:57.059+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12477327/comment/12927408","id":"12927408","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"I logged DERBY-4881 for the deadlock issue.
