As a result, both solr-core and solrj resources are co-mingled.  I think this is what's happening here: due to the apparently non-deterministic solr-home detection logic, in some environments, the \"wrong\" {{schema.xml}} file is used with some tests.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2012-09-01T17:44:45.425+0000","updated":"2012-09-01T17:44:45.425+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605861/comment/13446769","id":"13446769","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"body":"This patch separates solrj testing under Maven so that it runs on its own, rather than with solr-core.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, solrj needs to include solr-core source as test source, and include all solr-core dependencies as test dependencies.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass for me locally.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2012-09-01T18:04:18.220+0000","updated":"2012-09-01T18:04:18.220+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605861/comment/13446999","id":"13446999","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"body":"I committed the patch making solrj run its own tests to branch_4x and trunk.\r\n\r\nbq.
