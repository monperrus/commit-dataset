restart).\r\n\r\nCurrently this is implemented as a (generation, counter) tuple where generation is the seconds-since-epoch that the current node was started at, with some special casing to make sure that we bump it even if it restarts multiple times w/in a second. (see systemtable.initmetadata). and where counter is heartbeats-during-current-process-uptime.\r\n\r\nSo IMO the right fix here is to (1) make HBS implement comparable and use that instead of operating directly on the version_ [generation] int and (2) make updateHB only increment the counter.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-12-03T14:10:59.147+0000","updated":"2009-12-03T14:11:36.555+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12442315/comment/12785339","id":"12785339","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jaakko","name":"jaakko","emailAddress":"rosvopaallikko at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jaakko Laine","active":true},"body":"Yes, but the problem is HBS is compared with AP states also.
