The commit comments which describes the fix are as follows\r\n\r\nDERBY-3178\r\nThis commit modifies DataSourceTest.java to ensure that expected Connection events are fired to the\r\nConnectionEventListener. The changes have been implemented by having AssertEventCatcher in DataSourceTest.java keep track of what events it received. This state is kept in boolean gotConnectionClosed and boolean gotConnectionErrorOccured flags in AssertEventCatcher. The test then checks the state of AssertEventCatcher after the test has done firing the events to make sure AssertEventCatcher got the expected events.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.
