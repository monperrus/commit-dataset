This has the possibility of being an annoyance down the road. Unless specifically needed, why create this burden? Keeping the link between core properties and the descriptor package private allows for more flexibility in the future - and will keep users happier - we don't want to have to deprecate and change user exposed APIs if we can help it.\r\n\r\nbq. My understanding was that till a use-case exists, we shouldn't publicly expose the method ( and it's been quite a hard lesson...  )\r\n\r\nI think this is a great rule of thumb, and should be the guiding principal here. Whats the use case that this solves beyond what using the resource loader provides? The benefit should clearly outweigh having to maintain/support the public API.\r\n\r\nbq. Another question to ask before making things public is that can the user can alter some state in a way that can affect the functionality. If it is purely a read-only state I guess it should be OK\r\n\r\nI think it goes further than this - there is a public link between the descriptor and the core properties. Its not a huge issue obviously, but there should be good reason for publicly linking two classes I think - the fact that the implementation contains the linked class privately doesn't seem like a very good reason.\r\n\r\n- Mark ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2008-08-25T15:02:04.437+0000","updated":"2008-08-25T15:02:04.437+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12402975/comment/12625395","id":"12625395","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shalinmangar","name":"shalinmangar","emailAddress":"shalin dot mangar at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501"},"displayName":"Shalin Shekhar Mangar","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 688751.\r\n\r\nBowing down to public demand :-)\r\n\r\nChanging the methods to package private to insulate the public API from internal changes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shalinmangar","name":"shalinmangar","emailAddress":"shalin dot mangar at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=shalinmangar&avatarId=19501"},"displayName":"Shalin Shekhar Mangar","active":true},"created":"2008-08-25T15:17:05.668+0000","updated":"2008-08-25T15:17:05.668+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-724/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i03v2f:"}}
