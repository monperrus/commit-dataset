It simply changes all single single-quotes to double single-quotes, as that seemed to be the correct handling of all the cases I found.\r\n\r\nFor the drda and tools messages, the solution won't be that simple. That's because they get the messages through LocalizedResource, which handles messages with arguments in a different way than messages with no arguments. The messages that have arguments will be passed through MessageFormat, and therefore require escaping. The messages with no arguments are taken literally, and therefore shouldn't be escaped.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards changing LocalizedResource to always go through MessageFormat (just like MessageService does with the engine messages). That means we would have to escape single-quotes in all tools messages and drda messages, but that sounds easier to maintain than having some messages that should be escaped and some that shouldn't.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-11-01T14:21:56.953+0000","updated":"2010-11-01T14:21:56.953+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12473676/comment/12927085","id":"12927085","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
