For example, here is part of the lock table for three user transactions:\n\nXID |TYPE |MODE|TABLENAME |LOCKNAME  |STATE|TABLETYPE|INDEXNAME\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n186 |ROW  |X   |T2        |(1,9)     |GRANT|T        |NULL\n184 |ROW  |S   |T2        |(1,9)     |WAIT |T        |NULL\n188 |ROW  |X   |T1        |(1,11)    |GRANT|T        |NULL     \n186 |ROW  |S   |T1        |(1,11)    |WAIT |T        |NULL\n186 |ROW  |S   |T1        |(1,1)     |GRANT|T        |SQL070425023213370 \n188 |ROW  |S   |T1        |(1,1)     |GRANT|T        |SQL070425023213370 \n184 |ROW  |X   |T1        |(1,7)     |GRANT|T        |NULL        \n188 |ROW  |S   |T1        |(1,7)     |WAIT |T        |NULL   \n\nTwo of the lock entries have an index.
