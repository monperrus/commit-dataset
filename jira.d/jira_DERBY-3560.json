It only builds the ThreadDump class if jdk16 is set.  This means that for 10.3 if the class wasn't built and stress.multi tries to dump stack traces, because the test failed to shutdown the threads, the stress.log may print a ClassNotFoundException instead.  With this patch, on 10.3, you will get stack traces only if both jdk16 was set when you build and you run with jdk15 or higher.\r\n\r\ntrunk and 10.4 do not have the jdk16 build requirement because we have and can use  ${java15compile.classpath} there. \r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2008-03-20T19:54:39.964+0000","updated":"2008-03-20T19:54:39.964+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391984/comment/12581101","id":"12581101","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Committed patch to 10.3.
