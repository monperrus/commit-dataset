Policys only check the port number. So if you bind to 0.0.0.0:123 or 127.0.0.1:123 or a.b.c.d:123 makes no difference if port 123 is allowed by security policy.\r\n# The security policy as we have it does not grant ACCEPT on any different address than localhost. This means although all Solr servers opening public ports on 0.0.0.0 while running tests, *the Java 'Firewall' (LOL) protects you by only allowing connections from localhost not external IPs*\r\n# The policy pattern to do this is defaulting by JDK's to \"localhost:1024-\", which means it may accept connections from localhost on remote ports >= 1024 (as client, means remote socket address as seen from acceptor) and it may listen only on ports >= 1024. This works perfectly unless you have a broken network configuration, so we added additional policies:\r\n\r\n- As localhost may point not necessarily to 127.0.0.1 or ::1 (could be 127.0.0.2 or the public IP, some /etc/hosts are wrong in regard to this, sometimes windows), but Solr clients in tests always use \"127.0.0.1\" (hardcoded) as target address, the connection would be disallowed. So I added in addition to \"localhost:1024-\" we added \"127.0.0.1:1024-\" and \"[::1]:1024-\" as ACCEPT granted.\r\n- On the ASF Jenkins server we had another address problem, see: [http://freebsd.1045724.n5.nabble.com/jail-external-and-localhost-distinction-td3967320.html]. To explain: In FreeBSD Jails the localhost interface does not exist inside Jails, its emulated by the kernel of the main OS by mapping it to the real-world global IP. This causes that connections *to* localhost appear to the server you are connecting to like they would come from the public outside IP, but the security policy wants localhost. As ASF Jenkins is the only Jail we are working with and this setup is broken (a lot of software does not like that), I added another grant entry just for the public IP of ASF Jenkins so it accepts connections from this IP.\r\n\r\nFinally Robert fixed the recent Jenkins issue caused by the security filesystem sandbox, so the clover tests were not able to write the clover.db file outside the sandbox.
