This patch (the midpoint method itself and the change to COPP) will need to happen either way, and isn't blocked by the disk format change.\r\n\r\nIn order for the midpoint method to be useful for CASSANDRA-342, we just need to implement a RangeCommand which takes Tokens, which can be accomplished (sloppily, with a comparator to compare decoratedKeys and Tokens).\r\n\r\nThe SSTable tuple/index change would make that RangeCommand more efficient, and as you mentioned, will definitely speed up sorting, because sorting of the tuples can ignore the String comparison of the Key itself unless the Tokens are equal. We would probably be better served by blocking 0.4 long enough to get CASSANDRA-389 in, and then worrying about this optimization later.\r\n\r\nIf you still want to bring it up on the list we can, but I propose we:\r\n 1. Merge this,\r\n 2. Create a ticket for the death of decoratedKeys (possibly dependent on CASSANDRA-389),\r\n 3. Create a ticket for the Token RangeCommand (possibly dependent on 2, if we don't want to implement the sloppy Comparator for decoratedKey to Token).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"created":"2009-08-21T20:03:18.018+0000","updated":"2009-08-21T20:03:18.018+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12428409/comment/12747000","id":"12747000","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"body":"Updated storage-conf.xml to apply to trunk.\r\n\r\nAny feedback?
