It consists in invalidating the cache for each key we index. The downside is that this will invalidate all key that gets repaired, but updating the cache (instead of invalidating) implies reading on disk so doing this during the indexing or at the next read may not matter much. In any case, this is better that the current situation and after all .\r\n\r\nI however attached a patch (against trunk for now) that 'do the right thing' and will update the cache in the case of repair instead of invalidating.
