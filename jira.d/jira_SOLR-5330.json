(That is, if I expected facet values like \"abcdef\" and \"123\", I would get a value like \"123def\".)\r\n\r\nDebugging through the code, it looks like the problem was in PerSegmentSingleValuedFaceting, specifically in the getFacetCounts method, when BytesRef val is shallow-copied from the temporary per-segment BytesRef. The byte array assigned to val is shared with the byte array for seg.tempBR, and is overwritten a few lines down by the call to seg.tenum.next().\r\n\r\nI managed to fix it locally by replacing the shallow copy with a deep copy.\r\n\r\nWhile I encountered this problem on Solr 4.2.1, I see that the code is identical in 4.5.
