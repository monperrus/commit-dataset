I have attached the patch generated at the root level and followed the naming convention for the file.\r\n\r\nHere are my inputs on your other comments:\r\n\r\nThe reason for including a new method getOriginalNameForFunctionField is the ValueSourceAugmenter.getName() returns the name with a function prefix to it, as like this. \r\n\r\n public String getName()\r\n  {\r\n    return \"function(\"+name+\")\";\r\n  }\r\n\r\nWe can't change this method directly as it has been referred in few other places in the code, it may break other places. Even I thought of including a new method in ValueSourceAugmenter as getOriginalName(){return name;} but for this we have to change the abstract class DocTransformer and should implement this new method in all the child classes which are extending DocTransformer. So I dropped this option and wrote a method specific to CSVResponseWriter.\r\n\r\nOn number of instanceof used, in writeResponse method of CSVResponseWriter the responseObj type is coming as ResultContext only when we have functions in the query. so I am filtering the ResultContext instance and then the other two instanceof is required when one function is present in the query then the transformer type is of ValueSourceAugmenter and if we have multiple functions in the same query then the transformer type is DocTransformers (array of ValueSourceAugmenter) so we need to check these instanceof to process accordingly. In general the transformer logic followed for xml/json is different than the csv. In csv we don't have headers and the format also simple. Because of this difference the transformers are not considering the function field as a field for the csv type. Please let me know if there are any other better way to handle this.\r\n\r\nOn the test case, yes I can write a unit test case to prove this fix works. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nArun","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arun_mist","name":"arun_mist","emailAddress":"arun at mistminds dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Kumar","active":true},"created":"2014-02-07T13:14:58.662+0000","updated":"2014-02-07T13:14:58.662+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12677541/comment/13898049","id":"13898049","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arun_mist","name":"arun_mist","emailAddress":"arun at mistminds dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Kumar","active":true},"body":"Attached the updated patch with a supporting unit test to test the fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arun_mist","name":"arun_mist","emailAddress":"arun at mistminds dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Kumar","active":true},"created":"2014-02-11T17:25:00.866+0000","updated":"2014-02-11T17:25:00.866+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12677541/comment/13900808","id":"13900808","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"body":"Hi Arun,\r\n\r\n1.

I removed the new method getOriginalNameForFunctionField() instead as you suggested I updated the getName() of ValueSourceAugmenter. There are no impacts because of this change, I tested the unit test case\r\ncovering this ValueSourceAugmenter.\r\n\r\n2. Made correction as you & Hoss suggested\r\n\r\n3.

You can see that with the patch file I'm attaching now - your most recent one and mine are both there.  If you hover your mouse pointer over an attachment file name, you can see some metadata about it in the tooltip: who posted it and when.\r\n\r\nIn looking at your patch, I noticed that your solution of appending fields by getting their names from the corresponding transformers would put fields in the wrong order if a function pseudofield is not last in the requested fields list.  I reordered the requested fields in one of your tests to illustrate this problem.\r\n\r\nHoss's and my comments about the get-all-fields-from-the-docs loop already having access to all fields was wrong, because the transformation logic happens later, at the end of {{CSVResponseWriter.writeResponse()}}, in the call to {{TextResponseWriter.writeDocuments()}}.  Even if we had been right, appending fields in an order different from the requested order would have been wrong.  \r\n\r\nSo the field ordering problem has to be fixed based on the actual requested fields list.  The attached patch handles this in {{SolrReturnFields}}, where the requested fields list is parsed, by putting function pseudofields into the (ordered) requested field names - at present, the only consumer of this is {{CSVWriter.writeResponse()}}.  This solution doesn't need to change {{CSVResponseWriter}} itself at all.  I also added a test to {{ReturnFieldsTest}}.\r\n\r\nI think this is ready to go.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot
