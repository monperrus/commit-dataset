Wanvik","active":true},"body":"Uploading a patch for this issue, derby-5325a.\r\n\r\nWith NIO, writeRAFHeader has two methods leading to interruptible IO:\r\n - getEmbryonicPage\r\n - writeHeader\r\n \r\nCurrently, getEmbryonicPage may throw InterruptDetectedException and hence, so may writeRAFHeader.\r\n\r\nwriteHeader may throw ClosedByInterruptException, AsynchronousCloseException and ClosedChannelException because writeHeader does not use RAFContainer4#writePage, but rather uses RAFContainer4#writeAtOffset, which does not currently attempt to recover after interrupt.\r\n\r\nSo currently, clients of writeRAFHeader need to be prepared for all of InterruptDetectedException, ClosedByInterruptException, AsynchronousCloseException and ClosedChannelException.\r\n\r\nwriteRAFHeader is used in three locations:\r\n\r\n - RAFContainer#clean\r\n - RAFContainer#run(CREATE_CONTAINER_ACTION)\r\n - RAFContainer#run(STUBBIFY_ACTION)\r\n\r\nRAFContainer#clean is prepared for InterruptDetectedException only. The issue shows that ClosedChannelException may also occur, and it is not prepared for that (this bug).\r\n\r\nRAFContainer#run(CREATE_CONTAINER_ACTION) is prepared for ClosedByInterruptException and AsynchronousCloseException. Since IO during container creation is single-threaded, this is sufficient: it should never need to handle ClosedChannelException/InterruptDetectedException, both of which signal that another thread saw interrupt on the container channel.\r\n\r\nRAFContainer#run(STUBBIFY_ACTION) is part of the removeContainer operation which should happen after the container is closed, so it should be single-threaded on the container as well(?). It should handle ClosedByInterruptException and AsynchronousCloseException and do retry, but doesn't, currently.\r\n\r\nIf we let writeAtOffset clean up just like writePage, RAFContainer4#writeAtOffset (i.e.also writeHeader) would only only throw InterruptDetectedException, i.e. another thread saw interrupt, so retry. This would simplify logic in RAFContainer: we could remove the retry logic from RAFContainer#run(CREATE_CONTAINER_ACTION). This could also cover retry logic for RAFContainer#run(STUBBIFY_ACTION) wrt its use of writeRAFHeader.\r\n\r\nNext, RAFContainer#clean is already handling InterruptDetectedException and would with this change no longer see ClosedByInterruptException, AsynchronousCloseException or ClosedChannelException. This should solve DERBY-5325.\r\n\r\nI did not add a new test for this issue yet since I don't know how to force this scenario. We have only seen it once, I believe. I'll be running InterruptResilienceTest continuously with this patch along with the patch for DERBY-5312 on several platforms to gain more confidence.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.

The patch looks fine to me. It's great that the CREATE_CONTAINER_ACTION in RAFContainer could be simplified, so the checking of the name of the thrown exception was removed, since that approach would probably break down if some implementation threw a sub-class of the expected exception type, or if some later version of the specification refined the exception hierarchy.\r\n\r\nTwo minor comments:\r\n\r\n- copy/paste: The debug string in writeAtOffset says that it's in writePage.\r\n\r\n- RAFContainer4 now has three almost identical blocks of error handling code for the interrupted case. Would it be possible to factor this out? For example just do a catch IOException in readPage/writePage/writeAtOffset and do the processing of the IOException in a separate method?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2011-07-19T08:52:47.365+0000","updated":"2011-07-19T08:52:47.365+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12513487/comment/13067719","id":"13067719","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.

The refactoring patch looks good to me.
