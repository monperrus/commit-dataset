That said, the error does *not* occur in Derby 10.2 or main, so it has apparently been fixed in those codelines.\n\nI did some investigating and was eventually able to track the fix down to svn commit # 389202 (DERBY-690).  Before that checkin the query fails against 10.2, but after that it runs without error.  It turns out that there's one uncommented change in svn 389202 that seems to have fixed the problem, namely:\n\nIndex: java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/HeapRowLocation.java\n===================================================================\n--- java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/HeapRowLocation.java\t(revision 389043)\n+++ java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/HeapRowLocation.java\t(working copy)\n@@ -104,7 +104,7 @@\n    }\n \n     public DataValueDescriptor getNewNull() {\n-        return null;\n+        return new HeapRowLocation();\n    }\n \nTo confirm I undid this one line change in the 10.3 codeline and then the query started failing there.
