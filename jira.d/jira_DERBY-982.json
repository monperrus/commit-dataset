The approach I plan to take with the next version of this patch will compare the results for the version from the sysinfo API with the results for the version info as returned from DatabaseMetadata. I don't want to introduce another dependency on a version-specific master file, and I also do not want to introduce a test that exercises a tautology. That is, I don't want to directly compare the information used by sysinfo to generate its version information (the properties files in o.a.d.info) with itself.\r\n\r\nSo, my plan for the next version of this test will be to compare the version information obtained through JDBC's DatabaseMetadata with the information obtained via the sysinfo API. I believe this is a proper test of the sysinfo API: that the version information for a specific version of Derby obtained through the sysinfo API is equivalent to the version obtained through other means. This will improve coverage for our testing of the sysinfo API (currently at 0%) as well as verify that the values obtained via the DatabaseMetadata interface are correct.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nandrew","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"created":"2006-07-14T14:14:46.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-14T14:14:46.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12328961/comment/12421041","id":"12421041","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Hi Andrew,\r\n\r\nYour plan sounds like a very good approach.\r\nI'll have a look at the new patch when it comes.\r\n\r\nAre you planning on writing a JUnit test for this?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2006-07-14T15:43:42.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-14T15:43:42.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12328961/comment/12421299","id":"12421299","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"body":"Attaching updated patch for this issue. Test has been rewritten as a junit test.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the test for sysinfo.getInfo() is commented out because I was having a problem piping the output from the PrintWriter assigned to sysinfo.getInfo() to a BufferedReader that reads the first line from that PrintWriter. I'm not that familiar with piped readers/writers, so perhaps someone can spot what I'm doing wrong and fix that particular test. The problem, when the test is uncommented, is that the PipedReader hangs in a native method.\r\n\r\nThat could be handled in a followup patch, though. As it is, I think this patch could be committed as-is for this issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"created":"2006-07-15T08:22:21.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-15T08:22:21.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12328961/comment/12421505","id":"12421505","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"body":"Helps to read the javadoc.

Looks good to me, but I have one minor comment on the JUnit test.\r\nAlthough not too important for this test, it would be nice to have the constructor that takes a String argument.
