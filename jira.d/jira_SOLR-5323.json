Hmmm, I agree this is a bug.\r\n\r\nOk, I admit I don't know what is the \"right\" way to fix this. I also don't think this issue applies to the clustering contrib only.\r\n\r\nThere are several <lib/> elements in the example configuration and they all use relative paths to load additional components. So after you change the relative folder structure any \"example\" using these will fail to load, the clustering component just happens to be loaded eagerly so it triggers a failure sooner.\r\n\r\nI've had real life use cases when hard-coded relative paths proved very confusing so I'd opt for something like Erik mentioned -- making <lib/> components reference JARs relative to some notion of an \"installation\" folder. Ideally, this should also be inferred automatically if it's not given on command line and if somebody runs Solr from the unpacked default structure. I can prepare a patch that will try to guess and set \"solr.install.dir\" based on the classloader URI leading to one of the core classes (SolrCore, for example). Once we locate the core JAR we can sniff for ../contrib and ../dist and if these are present set the install dir in the upper folder.\r\n\r\nThis is, obviously, a hack. If somebody runs from a WAR file or changes the default directory structure things will break. I assume if they do so they'll also be able to change the example's default paths (or override solr.install.dir explicitly).\r\n\r\nI'm also not 100% confident how the above will work in the distributed setting -- soliciting feedback here.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if the above sound all right I will prepare a patch. I don't have any sensible alternatives other than turning off the clustering component by default. I would be against this, however, because like I said -- this only hides the problem, not solves it (the default configuration will still  be \"unmovable\" from the default directory structure).\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"created":"2013-10-10T10:13:09.765+0000","updated":"2013-10-10T10:13:09.765+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12673017/comment/13792824","id":"13792824","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"I also think this was a mistake - I don't know that we need another solr.home type thing to address it though.\r\n\r\nThe root of the issue is that the clustering is not \"really\" lazy loading clustering - and the current policy is to lazy load the contrib modules - and that is because of the component. I think Erik is on to the right path with lazy SearchComponents. I think that if the only request handlers that refer to a search component are lazy, they should probably also init lazily.

Like I mentioned there were several times when I had to pass an example preconfigured solr configuration to somebody -- this always required that person to put the content of the example under a specific directory in Solr distribution, otherwise things wouldn't work because of relative paths. It was a pain to explain why this step is needed and to enforce... I ended up just copying the required JARs into the example. This seems wrong somehow -- if it's a solr distribution then there should be a way to reference contribs in a way that allows people to have their stuff in any folder hierarchy?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"created":"2013-10-11T17:26:16.557+0000","updated":"2013-10-11T17:26:16.557+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12673017/comment/13792850","id":"13792850","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"I just think anything with the relative paths is a separate issue.\r\n\r\nYou can use any hierarchy - you just have to change those paths. I'm all for that being improved somehow, but the issue here seems to be:\r\n\r\nSolr contrib modules are lazy loaded so that if you don't use them, you can delete any of them from the dist package layout and things still work. Or you can not delete them and if you try and use them, things work. Clustering now violates that.
