shouldnt the size of \"boundPoints\" list be the same as \"numPoints\"..?\r\n\r\nAlso in referring to this thread, the number of members printed by each cluster matched the number of boundPoints for that cluster. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions..?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gaurav14","name":"gaurav14","emailAddress":"gauravredkar at gmail dot

I want a clarification regarding the difference between the variables \"numPoints\" and \"boundPoints\"  as mentioned in my previous comment above. \r\n\r\nThe point to note is that the size of \"boundPoints\" (\"boundpoints\" is a list of points belonging to a cluster) that i tried to print by tweaking the clusterdumper code actually matched the number of points printed in each cluster. so could it be that the \"numPoints\" was not properly calculated at the end of last iteration before the algorithm terminates..?
