If it happens it would hopefully affect only the worker thread that crashed. Most of the Error subclasses are pretty serious and the JVM will come down in many cases. OOME isn't necessarily one of these - what happens depends on the nature of the shortage and in which threads an OOME is raised. Further, a single hung ClientThread may not be a problem, assuming that database resources (like locks) have been
