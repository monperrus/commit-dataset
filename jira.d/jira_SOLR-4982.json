This patch preserves any parameters passed in on the admin URL, e.g. dataDir, config etc.\r\n\r\nOddly, you have to specify instanceDir even though it isn't a valid property for core.properties, else how do we let the user specify something not immediately below <solrhome>?\r\n\r\nBut my remaining problem is that I can't exit the test gracefully, searchers are left hanging and we get the partial stack trace below.\r\n\r\nThis usually means we did a CoreContainer.get and no corresponding close, but there aren't any such things. I think I even closed loading properties this time, although that would be unrelated I think.\r\n\r\nWhen we create cores in old-style solr.xml land, there's no need to do anything special to exit the tests.
