More specifically, and XML document can include a pointer to a schema document, which Xerces will then try to read.  In order for that to work the Xerces classes would have to have read permission on user.dir, but we can't add that permission to the derby_tests.policy file because the Xerces classes could be in a Xerces jar anywhere on the system, or they could be included the JVM's own jar (ex. IBM 1.4).  And further, when DERBY-567 is fixed the parser that is used could vary from JVM to JVM, so it might not be Xerces but some other parser that needs read permission. \n\nOne workaround would be to grant read FilePermission on {user.dir} to \"all\" (when I did that the test ran cleanly), but it seems to me like that would defeat the purpose of much of the security manager testing.  So until a better\noption arises, I think the only (or at least, the easiest) option is to just run this specific test with no security manager.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"40506","summary":"lang/xmlBinding.java fails with Security Expression","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310090":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12310050":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":6,"total":6,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12345887/comment/12420728","id":"12420728","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"body":"Attaching a simple patch to disable security manager for lang/xmlBinding.java.
