You are right, we could do that and I was actually\r\nthinking about it already. The problem is if I make this fix than testFQ7 fails\r\nfor TestSimpleExplanationsOfNonMatches because it is assumed that all\r\nnon matching docs have a score of 0.0. I can easily change that, so that non\r\nmatching docs can either have a score of 0.0 or NaN but I was not sure if we\r\nwant that, because other scoring bugs resulting in a score of NaN (which we \r\nwill hopefully never have) wouldn't be noticed then anymore.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I argued that testFQ7 is an invalid test case is that it would\r\nfail for any other query with a boost set to 0. Ironically we have this test\r\nonly for FilteredQuery, the only query class that ignores the boost, which\r\nmade it pass in the past.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelbusch","name":"michaelbusch","emailAddress":"buschmic at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Busch","active":true},"created":"2007-05-29T02:06:12.313+0000","updated":"2007-05-29T02:06:12.313+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12353911/comment/12499668","id":"12499668","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"\r\n\r\nAhhhh ... yes, looking back at the comments in LUCENE-557 I remember now: I originally thought boosts of 0.0 were legal for all queries, and then discovered i was wrong, and removed a bunch of tests -- but i clearly missed this one because it wasn't failing.\r\n\r\nwe should go ahead and remove the test ... but we should probably also fix FilteredQuery so that a boost of 0 produces some other result then just a NaN score (either an exception, or a score of 0) since as you say: NaN scores are bad.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2007-05-29T02:58:17.249+0000","updated":"2007-05-29T02:58:17.249+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12353911/comment/12499673","id":"12499673","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelbusch","name":"michaelbusch","emailAddress":"buschmic at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Busch","active":true},"body":"> but we should probably also fix FilteredQuery so that a boost of 0 \r\n> produces some other result then just a NaN score (either an exception,\r\n> or a score of 0) since as you say: NaN scores are bad.\r\n\r\nTermQuery actually behaves the same way.

Quite cool and elegant idea actually!\r\n\r\nI guess then throwing an IllegalArgumentException in case boost=0 would\r\nbreak this. The question remains if we should fix the scorers to never\r\nreturn NaN. Hmm, I'm not completely sure how to do this. Maybe \r\nDefaultSimilarity.queryNorm() should return 0 instead of Infinity in \r\ncase sumOfSquaredWeights is 0. But then with custom Similarity \r\nimplemenations we could still end up getting NaN.\r\n\r\nA different solution of course is to fix it in the scorers itself, to\r\nreturn a score of 0 in case boost is 0. But then we'd have to add \r\nchecks in the score() and explain() methods, which might be a \r\nperformance overhead.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure if we should \"fix\" this at all considering these \r\ndifficulties and the fact that nobody complained (I think?) about the \r\nNaN so far.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll go ahead and commit LUCENE-698 since this NaN problem is a \r\nseparate issue and not only happing for the FilteredQuery.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelbusch","name":"michaelbusch","emailAddress":"buschmic at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Busch","active":true},"created":"2007-05-30T22:38:05.990+0000","updated":"2007-05-30T22:38:05.990+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12353911/comment/12500257","id":"12500257","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelbusch","name":"michaelbusch","emailAddress":"buschmic at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Busch","active":true},"body":"Patch committed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelbusch","name":"michaelbusch","emailAddress":"buschmic at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Busch","active":true},"created":"2007-05-30T23:11:20.176+0000","updated":"2007-05-30T23:11:20.176+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12353911/comment/12500427","id":"12500427","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","emailAddress":"cutting at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true},"body":"> If boost is zero, then\r\n> sumOfSquaredWeights() returns zero as well, resulting in a\r\n> queryNorm of Infinity (due to a div by zero if DefaultSimilarity is\r\n> used).
