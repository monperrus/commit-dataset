Here's my proposal:\r\n\r\nPROBLEM\r\n\r\nPreparedStatement.setUnicodeStream() and ResultSet.getUnicodeStream()\r\nthrow SQLException when invoked after upgrading to Apache Derby 10.2.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOM\r\n\r\nCalling either of these methods will result in an exception with\r\nSQLSTATE 0A000 and message: \"Feature not implemented: ...\"\r\n\r\nCAUSE\r\n\r\nPreparedStatement.setUnicodeStream() and ResultSet.getUnicodeStream()\r\nhave been deprecated since JDBC 2.0. Derby's implemetation of these\r\nmethods was broken, and it was decided that the methods should throw a\r\nnot-implemented exception instead of being fixed.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\n\r\nThis was an intentional change. No Derby product solution is offered.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND\r\n\r\nUse setCharacterStream() and getCharacterStream() instead of\r\nsetUnicodeStream() and getUnicodeStream().","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-07-13T18:15:29.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-13T18:15:29.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/32160/comment/12420864","id":"12420864","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=olav","name":"olav","emailAddress":"olav dot sandstaa at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Olav Sandstaa","active":true},"body":"Knut Anders, thanks for the proposal to release notes.
