So for this only the first rule applies, in which it is enough to escape the 4 well-known escapes and also the forward slash + single quote ('). The latter two ones do not need to be escaped if used in text, but for safety we could include them.\r\n\r\nIn any case I would like to unify the different approaches of HTML escaping. As we are not working in unquoted attributes (we just encode floating HTML text), I would use Robert's code without the extra numeric escapes.\r\n\r\nThe official HTML4 spec (I used HTML4, the passage is the same for other HTML, see [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/charset.html#h-5.3.2]): \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nFour character entity references deserve special mention since they are frequently used to escape special characters:\r\n\r\n\"&lt;\" represents the < sign.\r\n\"&gt;\" represents the > sign.\r\n\"&amp;\" represents the & sign.\r\n\"&quot; represents the \" mark.\r\nAuthors wishing to put the \"<\" character in text should use \"&lt;\" (ASCII decimal 60) to avoid possible confusion with the beginning of a tag (start tag open delimiter). Similarly, authors should use \"&gt;\" (ASCII decimal 62) in text instead of \">\" to avoid problems with older user agents that incorrectly perceive this as the end of a tag (tag close delimiter) when it appears in quoted attribute values.\r\n\r\nAuthors should use \"&amp;\" (ASCII decimal 38) instead of \"&\" to avoid confusion with the beginning of a character reference (entity reference open delimiter). Authors should also use \"&amp;\" in attribute values since character references are allowed within CDATA attribute values.\r\n\r\nSome authors use the character entity reference \"&quot;\" to encode instances of the double quote mark (\") since that character may be used to delimit attribute values.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAny comments?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-08-29T09:26:41.531+0000","updated":"2013-08-29T09:26:41.531+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12666029/comment/13753720","id":"13753720","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"{quote}\r\nAs we are not working in unquoted attributes\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nYou cannot make this determination.
