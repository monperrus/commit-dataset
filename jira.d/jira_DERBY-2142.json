From the XAConnection , we  register the XAResource with the TransactionManager & return a java.sql.Connection to the application. \nA class implementing the ConnectionEventListener is registered with the XAConnection to get callback  connectionClosed ( ) when the thead closes the java.sql.Connection. In this callback,  we invoke XAResource.end & return the XAConnection to our pool  so that other threads can use it.\n\nWe have encountered NullPointerException  , when performing operation on java.sql.Connection.\nThe stacktrace is as follows\nat\norg.apache.derby.jdbc.XAStatementControl.<init>(XAStatementControl.java:71)\n   at\norg.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbedXAConnection.wrapStatement(EmbedXAConnection.java:162)\n   at\norg.apache.derby.iapi.jdbc.BrokeredConnection.createStatement(Unknown\nSource)\n   at\ncom.gemstone.gemfire.internal.datasource.ConnectionPoolingTest$1.run(ConnectionPoolingTest.java:174)\n   at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:595)\n\n\nI have done some debugging on source code of  db-derby-10.2.1.6-src & have following explanation of the bug & a suggested fix. However, I want to confirm that it is genuinely a bug & not a problem in our understanding of the Datasource spec behaviour.\n\nReason for the bug:-\n\nThe class EmbedPooledConnection.java   stores in the field currentConnectionHandle ( of  class BrokeredConnection)  a reference of the java.sql.Connection object , being returned to the application, \nNow ,whenever the client closes the java.sql.Connection ,  the code flow is \n\nEmbedPooledConnection.close() --> EmbedPooledConnection.notifyClose().\nIn the function EmbedPooledConnection.notifyClose(), it notifies  my listener ( javax.sql.ConnectionEventListener) ) where I return the XAConnection to the pool ( after deregistering the XAResource). \nThe last line of EmbedPooledConnection.close()  makes the currentConnectionHandle  field as null.\n\nThe issue here is that  javax.sql.ConnectionEventListener.connectionClosed is invoked before making the currentConenctionHandle field as null.  Thus XAConnection is returned to the pool , ready for pickup by a new thread. This new thread obtains a java.sql.Connection whose reference gets assigned to the currentConnectionHandle field, meanwhile the previous thread completes the EmbedPooledConnection.close  making the newly assigned currentConnectionHandle as null.\n\nThus a previous thread's close makes a field null of an XAConnection, which has been assigned to a new thread.\nThe bug is easily reproducible  in a multi threaded scenario ( 20 threads or so) with a pool size of around 4 XAConnections so that there is heavy  contention on XAConnection. \n\nThe fix is to rearrange the code of EmbedPooledConenction.java 's closingConnection () as\n\nbug :\npublic  boolean closingConnection() {\n     notifyClose();\n     currentConnectionHandle = null;\n    return false;\n\n}\n\nbug fix :\npublic  boolean closingConnection() {\n     currentConnectionHandle = null;\n     notifyClose();\n     return false;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"37517","summary":"NullPointerException while using XAConnection/PooledConnection in a heavily contended multithreaded scenario","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashahid","name":"ashahid","emailAddress":"ashahid at gemstone dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Asif H.
