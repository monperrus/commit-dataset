maven repository via {{mvn -P bootstrap install}}.  The source of the non-mavenized dependencies was the {{lib/}} directories, which are empty until ivy resolve is done, so ivy resolve is a prerequisite.\r\n\r\nHowever, since there are no longer any non-mavenized dependencies (see SOLR-3308, LUCENE-3930, and SOLR-3310 - thanks Robert Muir and Chris Male), ivy resolve is no longer a prerequisite for running 'the maven build'.
