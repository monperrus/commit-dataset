Committing shortly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeastman","name":"jeastman","emailAddress":"jeff at windwardsolutions dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232"},"displayName":"Jeff Eastman","active":true},"created":"2011-04-10T18:07:52.389+0000","updated":"2011-04-10T18:07:52.389+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12480780/comment/13018123","id":"13018123","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeastman","name":"jeastman","emailAddress":"jeff at windwardsolutions dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232"},"displayName":"Jeff Eastman","active":true},"body":"r1090861 committed the fix","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeastman","name":"jeastman","emailAddress":"jeff at windwardsolutions dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232"},"displayName":"Jeff Eastman","active":true},"created":"2011-04-10T18:11:57.586+0000","updated":"2011-04-10T18:11:57.586+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12480780/comment/13018147","id":"13018147","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","emailAddress":"jira at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true},"body":"Integrated in Mahout-Quality #736 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Mahout-Quality/736/])\r\n    MAHOUT-552: Added static initialCanopy method to create initial canopies with original center type.
