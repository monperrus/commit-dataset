It's a little startling that the\r\nchange turned out to be in such a fundamental and oft-called part of\r\nthe code, isn't it?\r\n\r\nI think your change is very good, I just had a few comments:\r\n\r\n1) Your description of the change makes it sound as though we\r\nwere using the default schema when we shouldn't be, but the actual\r\ncode change appears to be to instruct the system to use \"sd\", which\r\nis described in the javadoc for this method as \"the default schema\".\r\nI'm just reading the comments in the code, not doing any deep analysis.\r\nI guess what I'm suggesting here is it seems like the javadoc for\r\npushCompilerContext(SchemaDescriptor sd) needs to be changed,\r\nbecause it seems like this method (as opposed to the no-arg version\r\nof pushCompilerContext()) is supposed to be used precisely when\r\nthe passed \"sd\" is *not* the default schema, but is in fact some special\r\nnon-default schema, such as the saved SPS schema in your case.\r\n\r\n2) Related to the above, I think it would be nice to see some javadoc\r\nfor the pushCompilerContext(SchemaDescriptor sd) overload\r\nexplaining what the meaning of a NULL \"sd\" argument is. In particular,\r\nit's not clear to me from reading the code why we need to test sd != null\r\nand only call setCompilationSchema in that case. Why would it not\r\nbe correct to *always* call cc.setCompilationSchema(sd)?\r\n\r\n3) Lastly, in your code comments in the patch you mention that this\r\nchange is significant not just for trigger SPS recompilation but also\r\nfor view recompilation, but I do not see any tests in the test section of\r\nyour patch which demonstrate how you change affects view recompilation.\r\nWould it be possible to add a test which demonstrates this new behavior? \r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2007-01-01T18:27:36.579+0000","updated":"2007-01-01T18:27:36.579+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12358800/comment/12461876","id":"12461876","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"body":"Thanks Bryan for reviewing the patch!  Let me attempt to answer your questions/comments.  =)\r\n\r\n1)  Yes, I agree that the Javadoc needs to be updated with regard to the current changes.  \r\n    I'll resubmit a follow up patch to address the code comments.  In the original code, \r\n    it appears that the SchemaDescriptor input parameter is never set even though the \r\n    javadoc states so.  \r\n\r\n2) There are 3 possible values(of interest) that can get passed into pushCompilerContext(SchemaDescriptor ):\r\n\r\n a) A null SchemaDescriptor which indicates to the system to use the CURRENT SCHEMA as the compilation  \r\n     schema.  (This is the same behavior as the original code.)\r\n\r\n b) A SchemaDescriptor with its UUID == null, this means that either the schema has not been physically \r\n     created yet or that the LCC's getDefaultSchema() is not yet up-to-date with its actual UUID.  Use the \r\n    CURRENT SCHEMA as the compilation schema.  (This is the same behavior as the original code.)      \r\n\r\n c) A schemaDescriptor with its UUID != null, this means that the schema has been physiclally created.  \r\n     Use this schema as the compilation schema (e.g.:  for trigger or view recompilation cases).\r\n\r\nOn a side note, if the check for UUID != null is removed, it will reveal another bug in the view binding or execution code logic if the compilation schema is set with case b) above.  e.g.:\r\n\r\nconnect 'jdbc:derby:wombat;create=true' user 'user1';\r\ncreate table ta (i int);\r\ncreate view sva as select * from ta;\r\nconnect 'jdbc:derby:wombat' user 'user2';\r\ncreate schema user2;\r\ncreate view svc (i) as select * from user1.sva;\r\nERROR 42X05: Table/View 'TA' does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe cause for the above error is due to the view SVA's compilation schema UUID being null       \r\nwhich is not correct, so setting compilation schema with case b) early has some side effect \r\non the schema binding logic in later stage.  It is probably due to a stale default schema in LCC.  \r\nI think I'll file a separate jira for this issue.  With the current fix, this problem will\r\nnot manifest itself.  \r\n\r\nI'll add the above comments to the pushCompilerContext() javadoc also.\r\n\r\n3)  Actually, the view recompilation does not use pushCompilerContext(SchemaDescriptor) directly but   \r\n     instead sets the actual compilation schema to the compiler context directly with a call \r\n    cc.setCompilerSchema(sd).  This may explain why the problem does not occur in view recompilation \r\n    cases.  The comment is there to remind developers in the future to pay attention when using LCC's \r\n    pushCompilerContext(SchemaDescriptor).\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"created":"2007-01-03T00:29:57.520+0000","updated":"2007-01-03T00:29:57.520+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12358800/comment/12461880","id":"12461880","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"body":"Attaching follow-up derby2183-trunk-diff02.txt patch to address code comments.
