inetaddress, to determine the ranges Bootstrap nodes are concerned with (for CASSANDRA-497).\r\n\r\nWe need to change that to instead have a Map of Range -> inetaddress, representing \"these are ranges that the given node doesn't own yet, but will, so send updates in that range there as well as its current destinations.\"\r\n\r\nThat allows us to use the same structure for bootstrap (new node X gets these ranges, where before it had none) and unbootstrap (existing node Y gets X's ranges, as well as its existing ones).\r\n\r\nThen actually implementing unbootstrap is just wiring up the streaming from one node to another.  See comments in the header of BootStrapper.java for the different moving parts involved in bootstrap; the process is basically the same.

Don't know if stopping the gossiper from broadcasting anything more after STATE_LEFT, would cause other nodes to convict it. This would be the simplest solution, but probably need to do something more creative to better handle all possible state transitions.\r\n\r\n(2) When all data for a pending range has been streamed, the receiving node should inform about the completion, otherwise pending ranges won't be removed. The simplest way would be to just gossip its token again, as this will cause pending ranges for this endpoint to be removed. Problem is the receiving end does not know when whole data transfer is complete as tables are streamed one by one.
