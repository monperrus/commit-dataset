The \"readLine\" method in ODBCMetadataGenerator.java was treating single backslashes as \"end-of-line\" markers and hence was not recognizing escaped sequences like \"\\n\".  It turns out that the check for backslashes in that method is unnecessary, so this patch removes it.  I ran the metadata.java and odbc_metadata.java tests with this patch and they ran okay, so I think it should be safe.  I still want to run some more tests tonight, just to be sure, but I thought I'd post the patch now since it is affecting another developer's current work (Mamta's).\r\n\r\nI will add another comment tomorrow indicating the full test results.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2005-11-03T09:03:01.000+0000","updated":"2005-11-03T09:03:01.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12325272/comment/12356704","id":"12356704","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"body":"Attaching a second patch that provides for a safer fix than the first patch, per Dan's suggestion here:\r\n\r\nhttp://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.db.derby.devel/9867\r\n\r\nI ran derbyall on Windows 2000 with Sun jdk142 and saw two unrelated failures (\"junit /framework/TestCase\" not found for the CompatibilityTest.java against DerbyNet and DerbyNetClient). \r\n\r\nSo if anyone could review/commit, that'd be great.
