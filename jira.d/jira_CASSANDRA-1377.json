One workaround for this issue would be to not use keyspace names containing hyphens.  It would be even nicer if streaming worked for keyspace names with hyphens, since keyspaces named like that seem to be fine in all other ways.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n 1. With a multi-node ring, load up a keyspace with a hyphen in its name\r\n 2. Add some data to that keyspace\r\n 3. nodetool repair\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nRepair operations complete normally\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nRepair operations don't complete normally.
