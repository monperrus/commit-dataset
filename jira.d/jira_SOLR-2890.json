that field types can have are...\" and lists omitTermFreqAndPositions.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I created a custom type for ISBNs specified like so:\r\n\r\n        <fieldType name=\"isbn\" class=\"solr.TextField\" stored=\"true\" sortMissingLast=\"true\" omitNorms=\"true\" omitTermFreqAndPositions=\"true\">\r\n            <analyzer>\r\n                <!-- Remove anything not a digit or X -->\r\n                <charFilter class=\"solr.PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory\"\r\n                    pattern=\"[^0-9Xx]\"\r\n                    replacement=\"\"\r\n                    replace=\"all\"\r\n                    />\r\n                <tokenizer class=\"solr.KeywordTokenizerFactory\" />\r\n                <filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\"/>\r\n            </analyzer>\r\n        </fieldType>\r\n        \r\n\r\nwith the field definition like so:\r\n\r\n        <field name=\"isbn\" type=\"isbn\" omitTermFreqAndPositions=\"true\" multiValued=\"true\" />\r\n\r\nIt was surprising, then, to find that my core's index directory had 600MB of *.prx files, when there should not be any position information anywhere in the core.\r\n\r\nWhen I then updated the field definition to:\r\n\r\n        <field name=\"isbn\" type=\"isbn\" omitTermFreqAndPositions=\"true\" multiValued=\"true\" />\r\n\r\nand reindexed the core, the *.prx files were no longer created.\r\n\r\nBased on David Smiley's reading of the code at in TextField.java, the culprit seems to be:\r\n\r\n    if (schema.getVersion()> 1.1f) properties &= ~OMIT_TF_POSITIONS;\r\n\r\nwhich is at least reassuring that omitNorms and omitPositions seem to be unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe fix to this could be as simple as changing the wiki to state that omitTermFreqAndPositions must be specified at the field level.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=petdance","name":"petdance","emailAddress":"andy at petdance dot

It's \"minor\" because the work-around is trivial.\r\n\r\nMinor aside:  You should use a regex at the TokenFilter level, not the CharFilter.  It's a bit slower at the CharFilter and there might be problems with highlighting if you use the regex to change the field length.  CharFilters are designed to work in advance of the Tokenizer when you need to modify what the Tokenizer sees.
