Since we have three different places in the code that need to do the same set of operations when a temporary file is discarded, I factored it out in a separate method, releaseTempFile().\r\n\r\nI also moved the field lobFile (of type StorageFile) from LOBStreamControl to LOBFile, since it should always be in sync with the field tmpField (of type LOBFile) and the current handling of those fields is a bit confusing (for instance, we only null out tmpFile in free() and truncate(), which works since we always check for tmpFile==null instead of lobFile==null, but it leaves LOBStreamControl in a confusing state). By making it a final field in LOBFile, we automatically get consistency between the two, and the new method releaseTempFile() becomes a one-argument method instead of a two-argument method.\r\n\r\nDerbyall and suites.All ran cleanly with the patch, and I have manually verified that the uploaded repro does not create thousands of temporary files.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-10-10T09:54:26.690+0000","updated":"2008-10-10T09:54:26.690+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12405465/comment/12639005","id":"12639005","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"The patch looks good to me.
