What if it were to be made fast, along with seekCeil() which is also implemented slowly right now too?  For example, say the first time either seekCeil is called or an ord method is called, then build up an array of term start positions by ordinal, which otherwise wouldn't be done.  Then you could do a binary search for seekCeil and a direct lookup for seekExact.  The lazy-created array could also then be shared across repeated invocations to get Terms for the current document.\r\n\r\nWhy bother, you might ask?  I'm working on a means of having the Terms from term vectors be directly searched against by the default highlighter instead of re-inverting to MemoryIndex.  I'll post a separate issue for that with code, of course, which \"works\" but isn't as efficient as it could be thanks to the O(N) of seekCeil on term vectors' Terms.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2014-08-01T20:25:02.930+0000","updated":"2014-08-01T20:25:02.930+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661295/comment/14083026","id":"14083026","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"Thats unrelated to term vectors.

Never-mind that part -- as I thought about it I realized I didn't need that after all.\r\n\r\nbq. But i dont think it should be in the default codec. I also happen to think term vectors arent a good datastructure for highlighting anyway.\r\n\r\nThe default highlighter fully respects the positions and other aspects of the user's query, unlike the other highlighters.  Some applications demand that a highlight is accurate to the query, even if the query uses custom span queries that do tricks with payloads, etc.  It would be nice if the other highlighters supported accurate highlights for such queries but they don't, so today, this is the applicable one for accurate highlights for complex queries.  The default highlighter requires a Terms instance reflecting the current document -- it currently gets it via a re-inverting into a MemoryIndex but it can be hacked to accept a Terms directly from term vectors.  \r\n\r\nSo you don't like the idea of enhancing performance of term vector seekCeil in the default codec?  Is that a -1 or -0?  This change I propose seems harmless -- the code would not create & build up the new offset array if consuming code doesn't call seekCeil or the ord methods.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2014-08-01T22:22:42.375+0000","updated":"2014-08-01T22:22:42.375+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661295/comment/14083065","id":"14083065","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"I also think its ok if we fix the codec to have a faster seekExact (not by copying stuff into a large array on the first call though, just by fixing datastructure / how it access data).\r\n\r\nThat would solve the actual problem here you have in a clean way.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2014-08-01T22:22:44.678+0000","updated":"2014-08-01T22:22:44.678+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661295/comment/14083072","id":"14083072","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"Sorry David, its not about being against speeding something up, its about how you propose implementing it.\r\n\r\nCopying all the data from the entire document into another array on the first read for the doc, that's a really trashy thing to do here.
