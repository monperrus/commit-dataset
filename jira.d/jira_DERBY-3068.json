In order to track down further I changed the test to delete the files immediately after the test which creates them rather than before the test which recreates them and changed deleteFile()  to fail if it cannot delete the file.  After this change I can't get the test to fail.  I think the changes are an improvement except that somehow they may be making the file deletion problem more intermittent.  There may still be an issue with import or export.  I'd like to commit my changes as an incremental improvement and monitor this issue further.  Patch is derby-3068_diff.txt.
