I've noticed that core.jar exists under build, and I assumed it's used by test-contrib, and probably is not recreated after core code has changed.\r\n\r\nI verified it when looking in contrib-build.xml, which defines a property lucene.jar.present which is set to true if the jar is ... well, present. Which I believe is the reason for these failures. I've been thinking how to resolve that, and I can think of two ways:\r\n\r\n(1) have test-core always delete that file, but that has two issues:\r\n(1.1) It's redundant if the code hasn't changed.\r\n(1.2) It forces you to either jar-core or test-core before you test-contrib, if you want to make sure you run w/ the latest jar.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n(2) have test-contrib always call jar-core, which will first delete the file and then re-create it by compiling first. Compiling should not do anything if the code hasn't changed. So the only waste would be to create the .jar, but I think that's quite fast?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone, with more Ant skills than me, know of a better way to detect from test-contrib that core code has changed and only then rebuild the jar?\r\n{quote}","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10120","value":"Patch Available","id":"10120"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"25710","summary":"Failures during contrib builds, when classes in core were changed without ant clean","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":7,"total":7,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459630/comment/12847307","id":"12847307","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Here 2 patches:\r\n\r\n*The first one only changes the following:*\r\n\r\nIt now does not do any \"short-circuit\" checks for the core.jar available, instead solely uses a property that is set by the parent.\r\n\r\nThis works good, now always when you compile a contrib solely (inside its folder), the core is compiled. If you run from top-level build.xml the top-level build compiles the core as dependency and passes the \"core.compiled\" property down to the contrib-crawl.\r\n\r\nIn contrib are still other short-circuits like this. E.g. The benchmark contrib checks, if the jar files of other contribs it depends on are available and only if not recompiles. This leads to the same problem is you change one of the depends-on contribs source code. In this case there is no way around a top-level clean, sorry.\r\n\r\n*The second patch improves more:*\r\n\r\nIt removes the dependency to build the jar file of lucene, it simply uses the classes/java folder. It needed some more refactoring, to get rid of the ${lucene.jar} property. In contrib-build.xml now a separate base.classpath ref is defined that can be used everywhere to extend the default classpath, also set by contrib-build.xml.\r\n\r\nThe patch also contains a refactoring of contrib-ant, to use a resources-folder like other contribs.
