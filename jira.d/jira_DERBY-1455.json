I ran the test 421 times with the jar files from the 10.2.0.3 snapshot, and it failed 337 times (80% of the time). With the patch applied, I ran the test 814 times without any failures.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when the test has opened four connections, closes three of them and runs getRuntimeInfo() on the server. The test expects that there is one active session on the server, but in some cases, the network server has not had enough time to clean up after the closed connections, and more sessions are listed as active.\r\n\r\nThe patch solves this timing issue by invoking Thread.sleep(1000) before calling getRuntimeInfo().","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-06-25T01:43:46.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-25T01:43:46.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12344904/comment/12417733","id":"12417733","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 417131.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-06-26T13:44:45.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-26T13:44:45.000+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-1455/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i07biv:"}}
