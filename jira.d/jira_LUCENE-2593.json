The SR now remains pooled, holding\r\n    onto its changes, in case a future commit is attempted and the SR\r\n    is able to commit.\r\n\r\n  * We checkpoint with IndexFileDeleter more \"finely\" now, so that as\r\n    soon as a new file is referenced (eg from writing deletes), IFD\r\n    knows about it.  This prevents incorrect deletion of a file eg if\r\n    a merge IncRefs and then DecRefs before we can checkpoint.\r\n\r\nI believe this issues goes back to 2.9, when we added reader pooling\r\n(for NRT).\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2010-08-10T14:58:27.245+0000","updated":"2010-08-10T14:58:27.245+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12471193/comment/12897325","id":"12897325","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=earwin","name":"earwin","emailAddress":"earwin at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Earwin Burrfoot","active":true},"body":"Yeehaw!
