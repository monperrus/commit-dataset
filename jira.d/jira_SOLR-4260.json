Since the New Leader can't reach Old Leader, it won't find out about 4 5 (assuming no other replicas have it either), but will successfully \"sync\" and become the new leader.

In my cluster, if I have /clusterstate.json:\r\n\r\n{\"cloud\":{\r\n    \"shards\":{\"shard1\":{\r\n        \"range\":\"80000000-7fffffff\",\r\n        \"state\":\"active\",\r\n        \"replicas\":{\r\n          \"core_node1\":{\r\n            \"state\":\"active\",\r\n            \"base_url\":\"http://cloud84:8984/solr\",\r\n            \"core\":\"cloud_shard1_replica2\",\r\n            \"node_name\":\"cloud84:8984_solr\",\r\n            \"leader\":\"true\"},\r\n          \"core_node2\":{\r\n            \"state\":\"active\",\r\n            \"base_url\":\"http://cloud85:8985/solr\",\r\n            \"core\":\"cloud_shard1_replica1\",\r\n            \"node_name\":\"cloud85:8985_solr\"}}}},\r\n    \"maxShardsPerNode\":\"1\",\r\n    \"router\":{\"name\":\"compositeId\"},\r\n    \"replicationFactor\":\"2\"}}\r\n\r\nIf I kill the process using kill -9 PID for the Solr running on 8985 (the replica), core_node2's state remains \"active\" in /clusterstate.json\r\n\r\nWhen tailing the log on core_node1, I do see one notification coming in the watcher setup by ZkStateReader from ZooKeeper about live nodes having changed:\r\n2013-12-11 15:42:46,010 [main-EventThread] INFO  common.cloud.ZkStateReader  - Updating live nodes... (1)\r\n\r\nSo after killing the process, /live_nodes is updated to only have one node, but /clusterstate.json still thinks there are 2 healthy replicas for shard1, instead of just 1.\r\n\r\nOf course, if I restart 8985, then it goes through a series of state changes until it is marked active again, which looks correct.\r\n\r\nBottom line ... it seems there is something in SolrCloud that does not update a replica's state when the node is killed. If a change to /live_nodes doesn't trigger a refresh of replica state, what does?\r\n\r\nI'm seeing this stale replica state issue in Solr 4.6.0 and in revision 1550300 of branch_4x - the latest from svn.\r\n\r\nNot having a fresh state of a replica prevents my idea for fixing ShardLeaderElectionContext's decision making process. I'm also curious about the decision to register a node under /live_nodes before it is fully initialized, but maybe that is a discussion for another time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I wanted to get some feedback on my findings before moving forward with a solution.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tim.potter","name":"tim.potter","emailAddress":"tim dot potter at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Potter","active":true},"created":"2013-12-11T23:35:00.383+0000","updated":"2013-12-11T23:35:00.383+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626072/comment/13845887","id":"13845887","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"A lot there!

PeerSync treats these failures as indicators that the other replicas in the shard are unavailable (or whatever) and assumes success.

We need a leader recovery process that doesn't rely on HTTP requests. Perhaps, leader recovery for a shard w/o a current leader may need to work differently than leader election in a shard that has replicas that can respond to HTTP requests? All of what I'm seeing makes perfect sense for leader election when there are active replicas and the current leader fails.\r\n\r\nAll this aside, I'm not asserting that this is the only cause for the out-of-sync issues reported in this ticket, but it definitely seems like it could happen in a real cluster.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tim.potter","name":"tim.potter","emailAddress":"tim dot potter at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Potter","active":true},"created":"2013-12-12T21:25:46.333+0000","updated":"2013-12-12T21:25:46.333+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626072/comment/13846775","id":"13846775","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"Ah, thanks for the explanation.

In a real network partition, the ZK connection would also likely be lost and the replica would get marked as down. So as long as the HTTP connection timeout between the leader and replica exceeds the ZK client timeout, the replica would probably recover correctly, rendering this test case invalid. So maybe the main question here is whether we think it's possible for HTTP requests between a leader and replica to fail even though the ZooKeeper connection stays alive?\r\n\r\nHere's the steps I used to reproduce this case (all using revision 1553150 in branch_4x):\r\n\r\n*> STEP 1: Setup a collection named “cloud” containing 1 shard and 2 replicas on hosts: cloud84 (127.0.0.1:8984) and cloud85 (127.0.0.1:8985)*\r\n\r\nSOLR_TOP=/home/ec2-user/branch_4x/solr\r\n$SOLR_TOP/cloud84/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh -zkhost $ZK_HOST -cmd upconfig -confdir $SOLR_TOP/cloud84/solr/cloud/conf -confname cloud\r\nAPI=http://localhost:8984/solr/admin/collections\r\ncurl -v \"$API?action=CREATE&name=cloud&replicationFactor=2&numShards=1&collection.configName=cloud\"\r\n\r\nReplica on cloud84 is elected as the initial leader. /clusterstate.json looks like:\r\n\r\n{\"cloud\":{\r\n    \"shards\":{\"shard1\":{\r\n        \"range\":\"80000000-7fffffff\",\r\n        \"state\":\"active\",\r\n        \"replicas\":{\r\n          \"core_node1\":{\r\n            \"state\":\"active\",\r\n            \"base_url\":\"http://cloud84:8984/solr\",\r\n            \"core\":\"cloud_shard1_replica1\",\r\n            \"node_name\":\"cloud84:8984_solr\",\r\n            \"leader\":\"true\"},\r\n          \"core_node2\":{\r\n            \"state\":\"active\",\r\n            \"base_url\":\"http://cloud85:8985/solr\",\r\n            \"core\":\"cloud_shard1_replica2\",\r\n            \"node_name\":\"cloud85:8985_solr\"}}}},\r\n    \"maxShardsPerNode\":\"1\",\r\n    \"router\":{\"name\":\"compositeId\"},\r\n    \"replicationFactor\":\"2\"}}\r\n\r\n\r\n*> STEP 2: Simulate network partition*\r\n\r\nsudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i lo -p tcp --sport 8985 -j DROP; sudo iptables -I INPUT 2 -i lo -p tcp --dport 8985 -j DROP\r\n\r\nVarious ways to do this, but to keep it simple, I'm just dropping inbound traffic on localhost to port 8985.\r\n\r\n*> STEP 3: Send document with ID “doc1” to leader on cloud84*\r\n\r\ncurl \"http://localhost:8984/solr/cloud/update\" -H 'Content-type:application/xml' \\\r\n  --data-binary '<add><doc><field name=\"id\">doc1</field><field name=\"foo_s\">bar</field></doc></add>'\r\n\r\nThe update request takes some time because the replica is down but ultimately succeeds on the leader.

In other words, the out-of-sync replica doesn't know it's out-of-sync and it's state in ZooKeeper is active. As you can see from the log messages I posted in step 3 above, the leader tried to tell the replica to recovery, but due to the network partition, that request got dropped too.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if the leader should send a state version tracking ID along with each update request so that a replica can detect that it's view of state was stale? I could see the process working as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Shard leader now keeps track of a Slice state version tracking identifier that gets sent with every update request\r\n2. Leader tries to send an update request (including the state version ID) to a replica and send fails\r\n3. Leader updates the state version to a different value\r\n4. Leader sends another update request to the replica; request includes the updated version ID; replica accepts the request but realizes its state version ID is out-of-date from what the leader sent\r\n5. Replica enters recovery","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tim.potter","name":"tim.potter","emailAddress":"tim dot potter at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Potter","active":true},"created":"2013-12-23T23:05:41.954+0000","updated":"2013-12-23T23:05:41.954+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626072/comment/13856009","id":"13856009","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"Yeah, that's currently expected.

Potter","active":true},"body":"Make sense about not waiting because of the penalty now that I've had a chance to get into the details of that code.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time on Friday and over the weekend trying to track down the docs getting dropped. Unfortunately have not been able to track down the source of the issue yet. I'm fairly certain the issue happens before docs get submitted to CUSS, meaning that the lost docs never seemed to hit the queue in ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer. My original thinking was that given the complex nature of CUSS, there might be some sort of race condition but after having added a log of what hit the queue, it seems that the documents that get lost never hit the queue. Not to mention that the actual use of CUSS is mostly single-threaded because StreamingSolrServers construct them with a threadCount of 1.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, one thing I noticed while is that direct updates don't necessarily hit the correct core initially when a Solr node hosts more than one shard per collection. In other words, if host X had shard1 and shard3 of collection foo, then some update requests would hit shard1 on host X when they should go to shard3 on the same host; shard1 correctly forwards them on but it's still an extra hop. Of course that is probably not a big deal in production as it would be rare to host multiple shards of the same collection in the same Solr host, unless they are over-sharding.\r\n\r\nIn terms of this issue, here's what I'm seeing:\r\n\r\nAssume a SolrCloud environment with shard1 having replicas on host A and B; A is the current leader\r\nclient sends direct update request to shard1 on host A containing 3 docs (1,2,3) (for example)\r\nbatch from client gets broken up into individual docs (during request parsing)\r\ndocs 1,2,3 get indexed on host A (the leader)\r\ndocs 1 and 2 get queued into CUSS and sent on to the replica on host B (sometimes in the same request, sometimes in separate requests)\r\ndoc 3 never makes it and from what I can tell, never hits the queue\r\n\r\nThis may be anecdotal but from what I can tell, it's always docs on the end of a batch and not in the middle.

One of the changes removes the import for RemoteSolrException from SolrCmdDistributor, but the doRetries method still uses this exception.  That method is very different in 4.6 than it is in branch_4x.  Everything's good on branch_4x.  Re-adding the import fixes the problem, but the discrepancy between the two branches needs some investigation.\r\n\r\nThe specific code that fails to compile with the removed import seems to have been initially added to trunk by revision 1545464 (2013/11/25) and removed from trunk by revision 1546670 (2013/11/29).  It was then re-added to lucene_solr_4_6 by revision 1554122 (2013/12/29).\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=elyograg","name":"elyograg","emailAddress":"apache at elyograg dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749"},"displayName":"Shawn Heisey","active":true},"created":"2014-01-17T04:59:06.907+0000","updated":"2014-01-17T04:59:06.907+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626072/comment/13874667","id":"13874667","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markus17","name":"markus17","emailAddress":"markus at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831"},"displayName":"Markus Jelsma","active":true},"body":"I believe the whole building now knows i cannot reproduce the problem!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markus17","name":"markus17","emailAddress":"markus at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markus17&avatarId=13831"},"displayName":"Markus Jelsma","active":true},"created":"2014-01-17T11:10:37.418+0000","updated":"2014-01-17T11:10:37.418+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626072/comment/13874686","id":"13874686","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mkhludnev","name":"mkhludnev","emailAddress":"gedel at yandex dot ru","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mikhail Khludnev","active":true},"body":"What a great hunt, guys!
