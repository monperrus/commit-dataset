The field that holds the cached scan is initialized by TableScanResultSet.openCore() if, and only if, the scan is updatable and uses an index. However, TableScanResultSet.close() unconditionally clears the information. So if a statement execution plan has one updatable index scan and one non-updatable scan, closing the non-updatable scan may clear information needed by the still open updatable scan.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch ensures that TableScanResultSet.close() only clears index scan information from the activation if it had cached information there itself. This made the NPE go away. The patch does not include any tests, and I have not run any of the regression tests with it yet.\r\n\r\n(By the way, I don't think this problem was introduced with DERBY-3301, but it probably made the optimizer pick a different plan (it changed how nested IN/EXISTS queries where flattened, I think) that made the problem surface. It may be possible to come up with a case that fails before DERBY-3301 too.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-03-30T11:13:02.690+0000","updated":"2010-03-30T11:13:02.690+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459261/comment/12851474","id":"12851474","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attaching a new patch which includes a regression test case.
