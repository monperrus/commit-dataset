Since we are in near-constant communication with all the nodes in the system, we should be able to leverage that for a solution that is both simpler and quicker to adapt to changing conditions.\r\n\r\nThis problem seems similar to the sliding window we maintain of heartbeat times for failure detection, but this seems too heavyweight to apply when processing thousands of responses per second.

The main problem is calculating phi is less than free, and doing so for each request to determine the least latent endpoint will be too expensive.  We can get around that by doing it up front when we add a sample and keeping a cache of the scores, but that means we'll have to add samples fairly infrequently, or at least batch the updates so the mean only has to be calculated once per batch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandon.williams","name":"brandon.williams","emailAddress":"driftx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054"},"displayName":"Brandon Williams","active":true},"created":"2010-05-27T21:33:54.274+0000","updated":"2010-05-27T21:33:54.274+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12462152/comment/12872655","id":"12872655","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"right, even for something simpler than phi we'd want to sample, say, 10x per second at most.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-05-27T22:20:01.946+0000","updated":"2010-05-27T22:20:01.946+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12462152/comment/12876752","id":"12876752","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandon.williams","name":"brandon.williams","emailAddress":"driftx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054"},"displayName":"Brandon Williams","active":true},"body":"Here is a dynamic snitch that listens to read latencies from other machines, accepts at most 10 timings per second, and once per second calculates the phi value for all hosts it knows about.
