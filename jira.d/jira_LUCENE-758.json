If there is an index and we open two IndexReaders where one is based on a FSDirectory and the other is based on a RAMDirectory, the IndexReader using the RAMDirectory does not recognize when the underlaying index has changed. The method IndexReader.isCurrent() always returns true. The testcase below shows the problem.\n\nI did not find an ideal solution to solve the problem. I think the best way would be to change the IndexReader.isCurrent() implementation from:\n  public boolean isCurrent() throws IOException {\n    return SegmentInfos.readCurrentVersion(directory) == segmentInfos.getVersion();\n  }\nto something like:\n  public boolean isCurrent() throws IOException {\n    return directory.readCurrentVersion() == segmentInfos.getVersion();\n  }\nAs far as i can see this would work for FS- and RAMDirectory. But then the implementing Directory classes have to know about \"segment\" files and there formating details.\nWhat do others think ?\n\n  /** \n   * additional testcase for IndexReaderTest to show the problem when using two different Readers\n   */\n  public void testIsCurrentWithCombined() throws Exception {\n      String tempDir = System.getProperty(\"tempDir\");\n      if (tempDir == null)\n          throw new IOException(\"tempDir undefined, cannot run test\");\n\n      File indexDir = new File(tempDir, \"lucenetestiscurrent\");\n      Directory fsStore = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexDir, true);\n      \n      IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(fsStore, new SimpleAnalyzer(), true);\n      addDocumentWithFields(writer);\n      writer.close();\n      \n      IndexReader reader1 = IndexReader.open(fsStore);\n      IndexReader reader2 = IndexReader.open(new RAMDirectory(fsStore));\n      \n      assertTrue(reader1.isCurrent());\n      assertTrue(reader2.isCurrent());\n      \n      reader1.deleteDocument(0);\n      reader1.close();\n      \n      // BUG: reader based on the RAMDirectory does not recognize the index change.\n      assertFalse(reader2.isCurrent());\n      \n      reader2.close();\n    }\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"27290","summary":"IndexReader.isCurrent fails when using two IndexReaders","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bmesser","name":"bmesser","emailAddress":"bmesser at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernhard Messer","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bmesser","name":"bmesser","emailAddress":"bmesser at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernhard Messer","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Operating System: other\nPlatform: other","customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":1,"total":1,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12359286/comment/12460555","id":"12460555","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Thank you for the full test case showing the issue!\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe this is by design.
