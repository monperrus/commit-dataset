One of the key usage scenarios for the JNDI spec in OSGi is for use from a web application bundle. While the web container may be able to put the servlets classloader on the thread (which of course is a bundle classloader) things can be different for JSPs. Web containers often support JSP recompilation, i.e. you update a JSP, save it and all of a sudden the update is usable, no app or server restart. A common way to do this is to load the JSP class in a classloader whose parent is the WAB classloader. As a result the thread context classloader will not implement BundleReference, but a parent will.\r\n\r\nGiven we look to the parent we absolutely need to search the whole hierarchy, after all who knows what other tricks a web container may be pulling.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=not","name":"not","emailAddress":"not at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384"},"displayName":"Alasdair Nottingham","active":true},"created":"2009-10-23T15:26:09.640+0000","updated":"2009-10-23T15:26:09.640+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438928/comment/12769264","id":"12769264","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=linsun","name":"linsun","emailAddress":"linsun at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lin Sun","active":true},"body":"I agree that we should search the whole hierarchy till we find one that implements the BundleReference.
