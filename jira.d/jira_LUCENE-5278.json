things).\r\n\r\nI also added some unit tests.\r\n\r\nThe main issues why tests were failing with your original patch:\r\n* reset() needed to clear the buffer variables.\r\n* the state machine needed some particular extra check when emitting a token: e.g. if you make a regex of \"..\", but you send it \"abcde\", the tokens should be \"ab\", \"cd\", but not \"e\". so when we end on a partial match, we have to check that we are in an accept state.\r\n* term-limit-exceeded is a special case (versus last character being in a reject state)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot
