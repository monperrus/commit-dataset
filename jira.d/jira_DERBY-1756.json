(sorry).  so reposting my comment.\r\n\r\nThe only change in the derby1756.2.diff.txt patch from the previous patch is to leave the code for eusridpwd check commented out in getUpgradedSecurityMechanism() with a comment referring to DERBY-1755 and DERBY-1517.   Since no other functional changes went in this version of the patch , I have not run derbyall.\r\n\r\nI ran the testSecMec.java test against ibm142/ibm15 and jdk142 with DerbyNetClient OK on windows.\r\n\r\nCan someone please review and commit this patch.\r\n\r\nThanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=skambha","name":"skambha","emailAddress":"ksunithaghm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunitha Kambhampati","active":true},"created":"2006-09-01T19:09:23.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-01T19:09:23.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348525/comment/12432210","id":"12432210","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=forsini","name":"forsini","emailAddress":"francois dot orsini at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Francois Orsini","active":true},"body":"Looks good - Thanks Sunitha.\r\n\r\n+1","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=forsini","name":"forsini","emailAddress":"francois dot orsini at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Francois Orsini","active":true},"created":"2006-09-01T19:27:18.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-01T19:27:18.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348525/comment/12432234","id":"12432234","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"i am looking at committing this issue.
