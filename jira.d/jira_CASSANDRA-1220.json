This patch includes the calculations from Table 5 of [Bloom Filters - The Math|http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cao/papers/summary-cache/node8.html#327], which is referenced in the documentation at the source of the table. This changes the optimal number of hashes for the Bloom filters created by {{SSTableWriter}} (with 15 bits per element) from 8 to 10, with a reduction in the false positive rate from 0.000852 to 0.000744. (The patch also extends the table to include false positive rates for 16-20 bits per element for future reference.)\r\n\r\nSecond, the values of {{BloomCalculations.optKPerBuckets}} were not correct, in that some of them did not choose the optimal number of hashes for a given number of bits per element, probably due to transcription errors in the past. This patch replaces that series of constants with an array of optimal hashes generated during {{BloomCalculation}}'s static initialization.\r\n\r\nThis patch should apply cleanly to the {{0.6}} branch and {{trunk}} with all tests passing.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12447813","id":"12447813","filename":"bloom-filter-calculation-correction.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=codahale","name":"codahale","emailAddress":"coda
