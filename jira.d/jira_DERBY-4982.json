The structure of this test code mirrors how the code in BasePage#setExclusive works in the following scenario:\r\n\r\nThe Derby store code is wrong internally somehow, so an attempt is made to grab the same latch twice. This condition is tested for by checkGetLatchedPage and it treats it differently in sane and insane mode as does store. BasePage#setExclusive does the following:\r\n\r\n  - in sane mode,  an assert error is thrown\r\n  - in insane mode, the code will do a wait on the monitor and rely on lock time-out to break the stalemate (waiting for itself...)\r\n\r\nNow, the test  T_RawStoreFactory#P024 calls T_Unit#checkGetLatchedPage. The latter \"knows\" that in insane mode, a hang can be expected when it tries\r\nto acquire a lack for the second time, so to get out of this, it fires off a thread which will shoot down the hanging user thread with an interrupt, so as to get control back: 08000 is expected. \r\n\r\nWith the changes in DERBY-4741, interrupting the test thread no longer works, since  the wait in setExclusive just retries. This means that in insane mode, the tests hangs until the harness' time bomb goes off. I ran my regression tests in sane mode, which wasn't affected by this logic, and was thus blind-sided.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
