The requests for facet refinements use a large number of facet queries, so those would become significantly bigger. This is only really going to impact performance on the network interface of the machine sending the requests. The responses still come back in the old format, and creating a multi-part POST request isn't more expensive that creating a normal one. So the request would take a longer time to transmit, and the shards probably need more processing time to assemble the parts. I'd be surprised if the increase in processing time has any measurable impact on performance. As for network connectivity, even with multi-part requests for many facets we're talking about sizes of in the order of some 100kB. Unless the increase in size actually saturates the network connection (which won't happen until several 100 shards) the penalty will be some milliseconds more delay.\r\n\r\nIt certainly seems inefficient and wasteful to use multi-part requests, but I don't think that the actual performance penalty is going to be significant.

About half of that time is spent at the client assembling the request.\r\n\r\nThe time was measured at the client and is the total time required for everything -- curl assembles the request, sends it to the server, the servlet parses the parameters, generates a dummy page, and sends it back. Client and server are connected with Gigabit ethernet.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, yes, the overhead is significant, but even with large requests it's nowhere near to being a bottleneck. Processing more than 6000 queries is going to take significantly longer than 80ms ;)\r\n\r\nBut YMMV of course.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=larsko","name":"larsko","emailAddress":"lars at larsko dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Kotthoff","active":true},"created":"2008-06-23T02:21:05.637+0000","updated":"2008-06-23T02:21:05.637+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385100/comment/12607151","id":"12607151","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gunnar","name":"gunnar","emailAddress":"gunnar at wagenknecht dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gunnar Wagenknecht","active":true},"body":"So what about making this configurable?

Single-part is the default.\r\n\r\nNote that this patch changes the current behaviour for requests with streams. When content streams are present in the request, multi-part requests are *always* used. This is because the request has to have mutiple parts and we therefore cannot specify the content type. For multi-part POST requests a boundary between the parts has to be specified in the Content-Type header, but this is unknown when assembling the request, thus the Content-Type header cannot be set.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=larsko","name":"larsko","emailAddress":"lars at larsko dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Kotthoff","active":true},"created":"2008-07-02T08:26:17.925+0000","updated":"2008-07-02T08:26:17.925+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385100/comment/12610074","id":"12610074","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"Committed.
