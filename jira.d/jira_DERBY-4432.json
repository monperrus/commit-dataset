It will be used until Derby actually requests a database to be created (when a unique name is provided).\r\nDirectories for created databases will be created in the dummy data store, which means it will grow with the number of databases created. I don't think this will be a problem, because the space occupied by the databases themselves will be much larger than the bytes required to store a directory structure. Further, I intended to delete the directory structure in the dummy store for a database when the database itself is deleted (this patch will probably appear under DERBY-4428).\r\n\r\nAn alternative to the current patch is to use a bounded map where the oldest entry is deleted when the bound has been exceeded.
