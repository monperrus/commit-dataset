patch to leave the key alone if there is no uniqueKey, and eliminate the \"doc-\" prefix when there is one.  I also added a new distributed test to prove that everything is working, and that turned up a few problems - some of which i fixed (dealing with warnings, and ensuring that TVC results are in the correct order for the result documents).\r\n\r\nOne thing i discovered that i'm not sure about is what to do about the \"df\" and \"tf-idf\" values when requested. in the test they have to be ignored because the way the distributed test works is to create a single node instance and compare it with a multi-node instance that has identical documents, and in the distributed TVC code, these won't match up -- but i'm not sure if that's a bug (because the df & tf-idf values aren't \"merged\" from all nodes) or a feature (because you get the real df & tf-idf values for that term for that doc from the shard it lives in) ... either way it shouldn't stop fixing the basic problem of TVC failing painfully in a distributed request, so i've opened SOLR-3720 to track this in the future.\r\n\r\nfeedback on this revised patch/test would be appreciated","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2012-08-08T04:28:53.481+0000","updated":"2012-08-08T04:28:53.481+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545934/comment/13430876","id":"13430876","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiehang","name":"xiehang","emailAddress":"xiehang at hotmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hang Xie","active":true},"body":"I use \"doc-0\" to make it compatible with single node mode so far as I can recall, as my client was expecting that for parser.
