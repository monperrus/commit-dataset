We could imagine the user specifing a function that takes in vector args to use to collapse the multiple values per doc on a per usage basis (ie: in this function query case, use the max value of the multiple values for each doc; in this function query, use the average value of the multiple values for each doc; etc...)\r\n\r\nwith that in mind, i think for now the most straight forward thing to do is to add a \"checkFieldCacheSource(QParser)\" method to SchemaField that would be cut/paste of checkSortability (with the error message wording changed) and make all of the (applicable) FieldType.getValueSource methods call it.  In the future, it could evolve differently then checkSortability -- either removing the \"!multivalued\" assertion completley, or introspecting the Qparser context in some way to determine that neccessary info has been provided to know how to use the (hypothetical) multivalued FieldCache (hard t ospeculate at this point)\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot

valued.\r\n\r\nThe one situation where i made a genuine code change was in AbstractSubTypeFieldType and the way it deals with the \"subFieldType\" attribute.  When it's used, the registerPolyFieldDynamicPrototype function registers a new dynamic field based on the specified fieldType instance.  I updated the properties used to generate these dynamicFields so that it explicitly specifies multiValued=false (it was already specifying indexed=true and stored=false)\r\n\r\nI could have just updated the test schemas so that the fieldType specified was already multiValued, but i think this makes more sense from a functional standpoint.  the existing code already enabled a use case like this...\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n<fieldType name=\"double\" class=\"solr.TrieDoubleField\" indexed=\"false\" multiValued=\"false\" ... />\r\n<fieldType name=\"xy\" class=\"solr.PointType\" dimension=\"2\" subFieldType=\"double\"/>\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n...so it makes sense that this should work equally well automatically...\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n<fieldType name=\"double\" class=\"solr.TrieDoubleField\" indexed=\"true\" multiValued=\"true\" ... />\r\n<fieldType name=\"xy\" class=\"solr.PointType\" dimension=\"2\" subFieldType=\"double\"/>\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2011-02-15T23:25:54.405+0000","updated":"2011-02-15T23:25:54.405+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497636/comment/12995612","id":"12995612","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 1071459. -
