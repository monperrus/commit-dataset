The reason is that TermDocs#doc() cannot be called when a TermDocs is first created, since it is then positioned before the first entry.  One must call next() at least once before first calling doc().  If the TermDocs is empty, then doc() should never be called.  Consider the case of passing an empty TermDocs to skipTo(int): the call to next must be made, so that 'false' is returned without ever calling doc().\r\n\r\nThere are other ways of doing this, like defining that doc() returns -1 before next() has ever been called, and/or returning Integer.MAX_VALUE after the last document.

Side-effects we had here  are probably local for this issue, but I have somehow bad feeling having different behaving implementations of the same interface. Sounds paranoid, no :)\r\n\r\nTo make things better, new classes in core like eg. OpenBitSet cover the case you described, when we have iterator positioned one before the first one, but they do not comply to other side effects.\r\n\r\nMainly, invoking iterator.skipTo(anything <= iterator.doc()) should have the same effect as next(), meaning that iterator gets moved not only in iterator.skipTo(iterator.doc()) ...\r\n\r\nto cut to the chase, should we attempt to fix all OpenDocIdSetIterator implementations to comply to these effects, or it will be enough to comment these differences \"relaxed skipTo contract\"? Current usage of  these classes is in Filter related code and is practically replacement for BitSet iteration, therefore \"under control\". But if we move on using these classes tightly with Scorers I am afraid we could expect \"one off\" and similar bugs.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to change specification and use this sentinel -1 approach, but honestly, this is way above my  head to comment...    \r\n\r\n      ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eksdev","name":"eksdev","emailAddress":"eksdev at yahoo dot co dot uk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eks Dev","active":true},"created":"2008-02-09T13:27:55.689+0000","updated":"2008-02-09T13:27:55.689+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12388100/comment/12567351","id":"12567351","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl","name":"paul.elschot@xs4all.nl","emailAddress":"paul dot j dot elschot at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180"},"displayName":"Paul Elschot","active":true},"body":"Some of the bugs caused by this skipTo() behaviour are hard to catch:\r\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35823\r\n\r\nBasically the fix was to guard every invocation of skipTo() with a target > doc()\r\ntest when no advancing should be done.\r\n\r\nIn the above case I still don't know what the exact cause was, as the last patch\r\nadded this guarding test in more than one place.\r\n\r\nOne way to 'fix' this is by adding to the javadoc of skipTo() that the behaviour is\r\nundefined when target <= doc(), and otherwise the behaviour is the old behaviour.\r\nImplementations should then define the behaviour when target <= doc().\r\nThis has the advantage that the only way to fix it is by reviewing all the\r\nskipTo(targetDocId) code when the javadoc does not completely define the behaviour\r\nof an implementation.\r\n\r\nAnother way to go about this is to consider target<=doc() on entry of skipTo a bug,\r\nand add sth like this:\r\nassert (notInitialized and (target >= 0) or (target > doc());\r\nat the entry of each skipTo implementation in the trunk and fix the bugs as they show up.\r\n\r\nFor the moment I prefer the latter, it is a bit drastic, but it gets rid of a lot of uncertainty.\r\nAnyway, when taking it that far, it's another issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl","name":"paul.elschot@xs4all.nl","emailAddress":"paul dot j dot elschot at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180"},"displayName":"Paul Elschot","active":true},"created":"2008-02-09T20:03:50.265+0000","updated":"2008-02-09T20:03:50.265+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-1169/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04ynb:"}}
