On a freebsd machine? i have no idea - but either way that really seems like it should be a separate issue from this one (and shoulnd't be a blocker for 4.0)...\r\n\r\nWill not work, as the FreeBSD VM also violates the spec, because the whole SPI framework for rhino/JavaScript is missing, too.\r\n\r\nI am -1 to the above patch, as it introduces a highly outdated dependency to BSF, which is wrong to use with Java 6 (BSF is *not* javax.scripting, its something different and outdated for Java 4 or 5!!!). So adding BSF would neither help ANT nor JavaScript to use the official javax.scripting.\r\n\r\nOracle JDK does *not* ship whith Rhino, it ships with its own scripting engine (based on Rhino, but definitely not Rhino!) as an SPI. The bug with FreeBSD and using Rhino as replacement \"hack\" (without BSF) is only, that the stock Rhino JARs on their download page do not ship with the javax.scripting SPI. Unfortunately as far as I know, this SPI JAR (script-js.jar) is not in Maven (I don't know, never found it).\r\n\r\nFreeBSD has a bug and we cannot work around all bugs! Every JDK out there has scripting (JavaScript), only FreeBSD JDK not.
