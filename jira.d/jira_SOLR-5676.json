Then, whenever a request comes in, SolrCloud will think it can't talk to ZooKeeper and reject the request.\r\n\r\nThese are the valid states that watchers can see with the current ZooKeeper version (3.4.5):\r\nDisconnected\r\nSyncConnected\r\nAuthFailed\r\nConnectedReadOnly\r\nSaslAuthenticated\r\nExpired\r\n\r\nConnectionManager currently does not handle:\r\nSaslAuthenticated\r\nConnectedReadOnly\r\nAuthFailed\r\n\r\nFrom my tests, it seems like the correct thing to do is just ignore these states:\r\n1) SaslAuthenticated - nothing has gone wrong here, so no need to disconnected\r\n2) ConnectedReadOnly - the client would only see this state if they specifically specified a read only client, so this is expected\r\n3) AuthFailed - this one is a little tricky.  If you try to authentication but fail (say you have an invalid JAAS conf), you may get AuthFailed, but depending on the ZK settings, you may still be able to communicate with ZooKeeper (i.e. see this in the log: Will continue connection to Zookeeper server \\\r\nwithout SASL authentication, if Zookeeper server allows it.)\r\n\r\nSo, it seems correct to ignore these states, possibly warning on AuthFailed, because that isn't expected in proper operation.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"371077","summary":"SolrCloud
