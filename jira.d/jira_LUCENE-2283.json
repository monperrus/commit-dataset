It's transient.\r\n\r\nEG with a single thread, there will only be one PerDoc -- it's written\r\nimmediately.  With 2 threads, if you have a massive doc (which thread\r\n1 get stuck indexing) and then zillions of tiny docs (which thread 2\r\nburns through, while thread 1 is busy), then you can get a large\r\nnumber of PerDocs created, waiting for their turn because thread 1\r\nhasn't finished yet.\r\n\r\nBut this process won't use unbounded RAM -- the RAM used by the\r\nRAMFiles is accounted for, and once it gets too high (10% of the RAM\r\nbuffer size), we forcefully idle the incoming threads until the \"out\r\nof orderness\" is resolved.  EG in this case, thread 2 will stall until\r\nthread 1 has finished its doc.  That byte accounting does account for\r\nthe allocated but not used byte[1024] inside RAMFile (we use\r\nRAMFile.sizeInBytes()).\r\n\r\nSo... this is not really a memory leak.  But it is a potential\r\nstarvation issue, in that if your PerDoc instances all grow to large\r\nRAMFiles over time (as each has had to service a very large document),\r\nthen it can mean the amount of concurrency that DW allows will become\r\n\"pinched\".  Especially if these docs are large relative to your\r\nram buffer size.\r\n\r\nAre you hitting this issue?  Ie seeing poor concurrency during\r\nindexing despite using many threads, because DW is forcefully idleing\r\nthe threads?  It should only happen if you sometimes index docs\r\nthat are larger than RAMBufferSize/10/numberOrIndexingThreads.\r\n\r\nI'll work out  a fix.  I think we should fix RAMFile.reset to trim its\r\nbuffers using ArrayUtil.getShrinkSize.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2010-02-24T11:00:50.073+0000","updated":"2010-02-24T11:00:50.073+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12457225/comment/12837793","id":"12837793","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tsmith","name":"tsmith","emailAddress":"tsmith at attivio dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tim Smith","active":true},"body":"I came across this issue looking for a reported memory leak during indexing\r\n\r\na yourkit snapshot showed that the PerDocs for an IndexWriter were using ~40M of memory (at which point i came across this potentially unbounded memory use in StoredFieldsWriter)\r\nthis snapshot seems more or less at a stable point (memory grows but then returns to a \"normal\" state), however i have reports that eventually the memory is completely exhausted resulting in out of memory errors.\r\n\r\nI so far have not found any other major culprit in the lucene indexing code.\r\n\r\nThis index receives a routine mix of very large and very small documents (which would explain this situation)\r\nThe VM and system have more than ample amount of memory given the buffer size and what should be normal indexing RAM requirements.\r\n\r\nAlso, a major difference between this leak not occurring and it showing up is that previously, the IndexWriter was closed when performing commits, now the IndexWriter remains open (just calling IndexWriter.commit()).

We only pass true for things like the terms hash, that keeps allocating RAM until it's time to flush.\r\n\r\n  * Can you also make the same changes to TermVectorsTermsWriter?
