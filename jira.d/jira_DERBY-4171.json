What do you think the behavior should be:\r\n\r\n1) The memory subprotocol defines a separate namespace of databases. In this situation, it should be possible to have two databases with the same name, one in the memory namespace and one in the namespace accessed by all other subprotocols\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n2) The first thread to open a database defines which subprotocols must be used to access the database from other connections--until the database is brought down. If a database was first opened by the memory subprotocol, then a database by that name cannot be accessed simultaneously by any other subprotocol. Conversely, if a database was first opened by the default or classpath subprotocols, then a database by that name cannot be accessed simultaneously by the memory subprotocol.\r\n\r\nI have two worries:\r\n\r\nA) We may not understand the current behavior of our subprotocols well enough. See DERBY-4172.\r\n\r\nB) The code may assume that there is only one namespace for databases. Adding another namespace may be tricky.\r\n\r\nI think I would lean toward (2).
