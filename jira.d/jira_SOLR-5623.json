I share your distaste for the obvious Java solution of endless exception wrapping. Another option is to log, but does the Lucene code log things? \r\n\r\nI'm working against trunk because I don't know any better. I'm inclined to stay out at the Solr level for now, and maybe make another patch for this idea in the core later.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bmargulies","name":"bmargulies","emailAddress":"bimargulies at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benson Margulies","active":true},"created":"2014-01-10T22:04:26.516+0000","updated":"2014-01-10T22:04:26.516+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688271/comment/13868400","id":"13868400","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bmargulies","name":"bmargulies","emailAddress":"bimargulies at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benson Margulies","active":true},"body":"[~hossman_lucene@fucit.org] I think the patch request is now good to go, again sticking with a Solr change and considering a Lucene change later on.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bmargulies","name":"bmargulies","emailAddress":"bimargulies at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benson Margulies","active":true},"created":"2014-01-10T22:23:13.116+0000","updated":"2014-01-11T19:59:39.212+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688271/comment/13875045","id":"13875045","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"bq. In general whats happening here is not happening inside indexwriter, its happening in the analysis chain. I think solr or other applications is the right place to add additional debugging information (such as a unique ID for the document) because only it has that additional context to ensure its what is useful to get to the bottom.\r\n\r\nAgreed ... but it would be nice if (in addition to application concepts like the uniqueKey of the doc) the exceptions could be annotated with information like what field name was associated with the runtime exception -- I don't think there's currently anyway for code \"above\" IndexWriter to do that is there?  \r\n\r\nThe flip side though is that having this kind of logic in IndexWriter (or DocInverterPerField, or wherever under the covers) to wrap any arbitrary Runtime exception (maybe IllegalArgumentEx, maybe ArrayOutOfBounds, etc...) with some kind of generic LuceneAnalysisRuntimeException that contains a \"getField\" method seems like a really bad idea since it would hide (via wrapping) the true underlying exception type.  We do this a lot in Solr since ultimately we're always going to need to propagate a SolrException with a status code to the remote client -- but i don't think anything else in Lucene Core wraps exceptions like this.\r\n\r\nI don't know of any sane way to deal with this kind of problem -- just pointing out that knowing the field name that caused the problem seems equally important to knowing the uniqueKey. (in case anybody else has any good ideas).\r\n\r\nIn any case, we can make progress on the fairly easy part: annotating with the unqieuKey in Solr...\r\n\r\nBenson, comments on your current pull request:\r\n\r\n* there's some cut/paste comments/javadocs in the test configs/classes that need corrected\r\n* considering things like SOLR-4992, i don't think adding a \"catch (Throwable t)\" is a good idea ... i would constrain this to RuntimeException\r\n* take a look at AddUpdateCommand.getPrintableId\r\n* your try/catch/wrap block is only arround one code path that calls IndexWriter.updateDocument\\* ... there are others. The most straightforward/safe approach would probably be to refactor the entire {{addDoc(AddUpdateCommand)}} method along the lines of...{code}\r\n  public int addDoc(AddUpdateCommand cmd) throws IOException {\r\n    try { \r\n      return addDocInternal(cmd) \r\n    } catch (...) {\r\n       ...\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  // nocommit: javadocs as to purpose\r\n  private int addDocInternal(AddUpdateCommand cmd) throws IOException {\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n{code}\r\n* this recipe is a bit cleaner for the type of assertion you are doing...{code}\r\n  try {\r\n    doSomethingThatShouldThrowAndException();\r\n    fail(\"didn't get expected exception\");\r\n  } catch (ExpectedExceptionType e) {\r\n    assertStuffAbout(e);\r\n
