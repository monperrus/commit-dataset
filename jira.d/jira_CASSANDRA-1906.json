The differences between the libraries are now known.\r\n- Taking a census of all the settings knobs and sorting them into JMX vs. Thrift needs to be done to make the separation consistent, or if this isn't done, then we should have all methods available on both Thrift and JMX. In either case, the reasoning is that future methods won't have to endure an argument as to their placement; i.e. either it obviously goes in one, or necessarily goes in both.\r\n\r\nThe core tenet of this improvement/ticket is making the code easier for future maintenance; the more unnecessary lines removed and the more commentary and documentation available the better.

YAML is still being used for the node config stuff, but there's much less magic there (specifically the verbose snakeYAML descriptions of config relations). We don't need schematool in trunk, but it will have to stay around in 0.7 for 0.6* upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe tests all use a SchemaLoader to init the keyspaces/cfs before test, and it calls readTablesFromYaml(). This mechanism will need to be changed to completely gut the method. It should instead be reading from a (static, visible) list of KSMDs passed in by the tests.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like Avro is leaving from the migration codepath, so CFMetaData will likely still have to deal with both thrift and avro objects for now. Builder pattern in CFMetaData helps gratuitously here to reduce code and confusion, and DefsTest/DD/CFS will all have to use the new construction pattern. There are two constructors: the standard one requires ks,name,type,and comparators, and all other values defaulted, private one for system CFs that set specific cfIDs, then a `CFMD foo( x ) {foo=x;return this}` for each prop foo to set it other than default.\r\n\r\nCurrently CFMD is mutable (and KSMD is not), so it doesn't specifically need to use a builder class to produce CFMDs. They're currently mutable because they are held in multiple places and there's a race condition when migrations come in. This should be simplified (either immutable and held in one place, or mutable with atomic references), but not for this ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFor all per-node options:\r\n- Permanent changes are only made by changing the YAML.\r\n- StorageService has all the JMX calls that change DD at runtime.\r\n- To make a permanent change without restarting, change the yaml and make the temp change. The next time it starts up, it's permanent.\r\n- No thrift involved in node state.\r\n\r\nFor all per-CF options:\r\n- Permanent changes must be made via migration. Thrift system_* calls, or the cli wrappers for such.\r\n- Each KSMD sits on its respective Table, each CFMD sits on its respective CFS. SST{R,W} also needs to be able to access the CFMD in a tight loop. \r\nExposing Table (read: Keyspace) changes the MBean hierarchy, and some changes should be made there as well to make it look more like the actual relations: \r\n{noformat}\r\n        o.a.c.db (tree root)\r\n       /   |    |      |    \\\r\n      SS   CM   HHOM   CL   KEYSPACES\r\n     /   (I/OM)             /     |   \\\r\n Config                    K1    K2    ...\r\n   |   \\                  /  \\\\\\  ...\r\n(D)EPS <NodeOpts>     Table   |\\\\_\r\n                     /       /  \\  \\\r\n                <KSOpts>    /    |  ...\r\n                          CF1   CF2\r\n                         /  \\   ...\r\n                       CFS1  |\r\n                      /    CACHES\r\n                   <CFOpts>   |  \\\r\n                             key row \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n- Temporary changes are made via JMX (nodetool, Table/CFS beans). They are stronger changes than new migrations coming in, so a temporary will persist until the node reboots, regardless of new migrations. To use the settings set in the most recent migration, either reboot the node or call unsetFoo() (next to getFoo() and setFoo()) for a given property.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jhermes","name":"jhermes","emailAddress":"hermes at datastax dot
