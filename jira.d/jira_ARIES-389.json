ConfigProperty beans, which then may be injected into other bean's properties on behalf of a special type converter.\r\n\r\nThe type converter in necessary in order to correctly deal with unconfigured aka null values.\r\n\r\nYou may have a look at our open source library under\r\n\r\n  http://maven.clazzes.org/org/clazzes/util/0.9.1/\r\n\r\nwhere the classes are contained in the package org.clazzes.util.osgi.\r\n\r\nWhen applying all this stuff on null config values in any aries blueprint version available to me at the time of writing, the null return value of the type converter has the effect, that the conversion algorithm in AggregateConverter.java continues with it's conversion machinery for all known types causing it to fail with an Exception.\r\n\r\nHowever in \"OSGi Service Platform Release 4, Service Compendium 4.2\" in section 121.9.3 on pages 689-690, there is no hint ,taht the conversion algorithm should continue after step 2, when a type converter has been selected in step 1.\r\n\r\nI will attach a fix, which fixes my problem for svn rev. 988025 on aries trunk.\r\n\r\nPlease review my patch and let me know, whether I shoukld improve it or you are able to apply it to the aries trunk.\r\n\r\n  Best regards, Wolfgang
