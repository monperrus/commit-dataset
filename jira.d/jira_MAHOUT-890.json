I have an example set where the current implementation seems to produce correct output, it just takes an unreasonable amount of time (4+ hours on a small set).  I'll be happy to provide a unit test, though.  Unit testing the tree manipulations on a smaller scale is problematic because the intent and invariants are not obvious.  \r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I actually spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to understand and fix the current implementation before resorting to a rewrite.  \r\nMy motivation for creating an alternate implementation was that I have a real dataset (of reasonable size) where the current implementation effectively fails to complete.  I've submitted a bug report, example data that demonstrates the long-execution problem, a toy example that can demonstrate evidence of tree-manipulation behavior that is almost certainly bad (but it is still not clear to me how to fix it), and I've also shown a naive implementation that completes quickly on the same data.  \r\n\r\nOn the topic of top-k patterns, I do not understand why it is desirable to repeatedly mine the same candidates/patterns.  The current implementation will find pattern \"a b c\" 3 times, when it could be found once and post-processed to create complete per-item lists.  It seems needlessly inefficient (especially if you don't care about per-item lists).  The way the code is structured, it is done this way even in mapreduce mode, even though the input itemsets are pruned in such a way that postprocessing is necessary anyway.  \r\n\r\nYou're right that there are a lot of boxed primitives in the patch; I also didn't pack the tree into an array representation.  I aimed for simple/quick to get it working; the boxed primitives in particular should be pretty easy to eliminate.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tcp","name":"tcp","emailAddress":"tcp at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"tom pierce","active":true},"created":"2011-12-05T16:01:58.055+0000","updated":"2011-12-05T16:01:58.055+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12532076/comment/13165747","id":"13165747","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=robinanil","name":"robinanil","emailAddress":"robinanil at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=robinanil&avatarId=14747","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=robinanil&avatarId=14747","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=robinanil&avatarId=14747","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=robinanil&avatarId=14747"},"displayName":"Robin Anil","active":true},"body":"Would you be willing to move the patch over to fpgrowth2 and to continue to work on the rewrite as a separate version until features are migrated.?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=robinanil","name":"robinanil","emailAddress":"robinanil at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=robinanil&avatarId=14747","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=robinanil&avatarId=14747","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=robinanil&avatarId=14747","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=robinanil&avatarId=14747"},"displayName":"Robin Anil","active":true},"created":"2011-12-09T01:49:06.557+0000","updated":"2011-12-09T01:49:06.557+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12532076/comment/13166452","id":"13166452","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tcp","name":"tcp","emailAddress":"tcp at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"tom pierce","active":true},"body":"Sure - I can do this.
