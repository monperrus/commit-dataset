It's very confusing now.\r\n\r\nThe Builder today only operates on IntsRef inputs; the other add methods taking char[]/CharSequence, BytesRef are sugar, translating to IntsRef.  Maybe... we should move these elsewhere (eg Util.XXX) and rename them to reflect that they are just converting XXX to IntsRef?  Then Builder would only have add(IntsRef[]).\r\n\r\nThe \"INPUT_TYPE\" really describes the allowed range of the input int labels...\r\n\r\nI'd love to parameterize by input type as well, but I think it's tricky (Uwe!?)?  Ideally Builder, FST, and the FSTEnums would take <K,V>; FST is just like a SortedMap.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2012-01-13T17:59:54.642+0000","updated":"2012-01-13T17:59:54.642+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538302/comment/13185726","id":"13185726","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"body":"Just a note.
