The corruption happens because of DERBY-4577. When the upgrade test tries to boot the corrupted database in soft upgrade mode, an assert added in DERBY-4577 detects the corruption and raises an error.\r\n\r\nSince the corruption happens in old, already released versions of Derby, and it's too late to fix the bug in those versions now, I think we could just disable this test case if the old version suffers from DERBY-4577 (that is, older than 10.7.1.1).\r\n\r\nActually, I don't think this is the kind of bug fix where we usually add an upgrade test. The patch doesn't attempt to fix this problem for existing triggers on upgrade (I don't think it could, since the information about which columns the original CREATE TRIGGER statement specified is lost). The main difference between the upgrade test case and the TriggerTest test case seems to be that the upgrade test case verifies that CREATE TRIGGER doesn't work as expected on some specific old versions. Since the behaviour of the already released versions is never going to change, we don't need to spend time testing that behaviour. The testing of the behaviour of the new version looks more or less the same as what was added to TriggerTest, so maybe it would be good enough coverage if we simply skipped the upgrade test case.

In the case where a CREATE operation is buggy, I'm fine with having to recreate the object to get it fixed. After all, triggers are no special in this regard, so if we add such a column to SYSTRIGGERS, we should probably add such columns to other system tables too in case CREATE TABLE, CREATE TYPE or any other CREATE operation turns out to have a problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2013-11-01T15:25:10.648+0000","updated":"2013-11-01T15:25:10.648+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674782/comment/13811541","id":"13811541","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"I think the commit of revision 1537593 caused failures in the derbyall dblook tests, both for client and embedded, see for instance:\r\nhttp://download.java.net/javadesktop/derby/request_5583609/javadb-task-3751113.html\r\nor \r\nhttp://people.apache.org/~myrnavl/derby_test_results/main/linux/testlog/ibm16/1537799-derbyall_diff.txt","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2013-11-01T18:35:57.944+0000","updated":"2013-11-01T18:35:57.944+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674782/comment/13813556","id":"13813556","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"body":"Commit 1538854 from [~mamtas] in branch 'code/trunk'\r\n[ https://svn.apache.org/r1538854 ]\r\n\r\nDERBY-6383(Update trigger defined on one column fires on update of other columns)\r\n\r\nFollowing old harness tests need their master files updated after the code changes for DERBY-6383.

Had to hand do the changes because of conflicts during svn merge.\r\n1537593, 1538854 \r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe reason behind the failure is actually how testDERBY5120NumRowsInSydependsForTrigger test was written and not a code regression. \r\n\r\nThe test creates a trigger which is supposed to fire on a specific column\r\n\tcreate trigger ATDC_TAB1_TRG1 after update of C11 on ATDC_TAB1 REFERENCING old_table as old \r\n        \tfor each statement MODE DB2SQL insert into ATDC_BKUP1 select * from old\r\nBut later on it the test, it is expecting the trigger to fire on update of non-trigger column of the table. This was fine before DERBY-6383 was backported because w/o the fix for DERBY-6383, triggers would fire on update of any column on the table(DERBY-6383 - Update trigger defined on one column fires on update of other columns). But after those codelines got the fix for DERBY-6383 as part of the backport, the trigger correctly won't fire any more on non-trigger columns and that started the test failure. I have fixed the test to update the trigger column in order to fire the trigger and now the test behaves correctly. I will backport this test fix upto 10.8 codelines which is how far DERBY-6383 got backported to.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"created":"2014-05-21T03:37:01.642+0000","updated":"2014-05-21T03:37:01.642+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-6383/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1p3lj:"}}
