that might be worth considering is inverting the delegation logic -- move the meat of getFieldQuery(String,String) into getFieldQuery(String,String,int) and make the two arg version delegate to the three arg version (specifying a slop of whatever this.phraseSlop is)   the down side to that is that existing subclasses which override the three arg version could find themselves with an infinite recursive loop.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot
