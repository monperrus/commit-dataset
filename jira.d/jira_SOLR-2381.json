When they then convert those buffered chars to UTF-8 its broken at the boundaries. This bug in Jetty may also affect JSON output, but JSON is much more compact and may not easily hit this buffer issue (as it does not use Strings to feed to writer, the broken method in JETTY is handling Writer.write(String,...).\r\n\r\nIn general we are discussing to not use Readers and Writers supplied by the Servlet Container. As HTTP is a byte-based protocol, code should only use InputStreams and OutputStreams to communicate with the client. Writers and Readers are only provided for convenience with JSP engines.\r\n\r\nThe input part of Solr no longer uses Readers, they pass always pass InputStreams around. I uploaded a patch a week ago to do the same on the output side of Solr: SOLR-ServletOutputWriter.patch\r\n\r\nPlease note: As JSP pages use Jetty's writers, analysis.jsp may still produce corrupt output.\r\n\r\nCan you patch your solr with that one, then your problems should disappear for all OutputHandler generated content except JSP pages in Solr. We are thinking about optimizing this, internally, but the above patch removes all use of Solr. The patch is against trunk as far as I know.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2011-03-09T13:58:35.260+0000","updated":"2011-03-09T13:58:35.260+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12499740/comment/13004567","id":"13004567","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=befehl","name":"befehl","emailAddress":"bernd dot fehling at uni-bielefeld dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernd Fehling","active":true},"body":"And here it is, the fixed jetty.\r\njetty-6.1-26-patched-SOLR-2381.jar\r\njetty-util-6.1.26-patched-SOLR-2381.jar\r\n\r\nPlease test it and give your feedback.\r\nAt least my problems are gone.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and help.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=befehl","name":"befehl","emailAddress":"bernd dot fehling at uni-bielefeld dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernd Fehling","active":true},"created":"2011-03-09T14:27:54.400+0000","updated":"2011-03-09T14:28:56.783+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12499740/comment/13004584","id":"13004584","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"Bernd, i didn't test your jars, but can you update the patch on http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-1340\r\nwith your fixes?\r\n\r\nAs an open source project, we can't just commit the binary jars.\r\n\r\nI did however, test Uwe's patch.
