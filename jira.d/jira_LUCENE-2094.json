Revert?\r\n\r\nNot from me. I don't think its a huge deal, certainly not something that requires a revert. I just worry some times about the pace of things - and that the more active one becomes, the more they/we should worry about allowing proper time for comments/objections when committing. I like how people have tended to err on the side of waiting for solid consensus myself. Its not a big issue here - but as we move away from that I think it will be. Its something that will spread as new users look at old users when determining how they act.\r\n\r\nThe more heavy committing one does, the easier I think it is to just decide stuff and cram it in - personally (and I'm just one voice).  The more you do, I think its also more important to allow brief time periods between saying what you are going to do and doing it (though that should always be done). Its easy to say, well we can just change it, or pull it out - but with lazy consensus and how the community works, I think thats conducive to worse code. Its much easier for someone to debate and have questions than it is to hound changes or code out of trunk. In my mind its better if the bottleneck is on the going in, as it has been, rather then shifting things to fixing whats in. Especially if there is debate in an issue still - whether it belongs there or not - I think there should be warning and consensus before a commit.\r\n\r\nI realize thats a bit of a tough sell based on this little issue alone - but its a general feeling I've been having as lucene dev has really been ramping up in recent times. I think its important we stick to being conservative about waiting for consensus - giving others a chance to voice their opinion - no matter how sure you are about your decision. I think its an important example for new users, and an important characteristic of Lucene development.\r\n\r\nThats just me though - I don't speak for anyone but myself.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2009-12-01T02:52:19.934+0000","updated":"2009-12-01T02:52:19.934+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441571/comment/12784025","id":"12784025","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"bq.

I still would expect anybody changing the behavior of this class to revise their usage.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"created":"2009-12-01T11:53:15.765+0000","updated":"2009-12-01T11:53:15.765+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441571/comment/12784190","id":"12784190","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"body":"Linked followup issue ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"created":"2009-12-01T11:53:52.825+0000","updated":"2009-12-01T11:53:52.825+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441571/comment/12784248","id":"12784248","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"body":"I have created separate issues for the outstanding discussions.

It looks like it was committed as part of this issue, but I can't find any comments here about either the need to make a copy or the need to make a unmodifiable set.\r\nI try to help you to reconstruct the whole thing a bit. UnmodifiableCharArraySet was introduces with LUCENE-1688 as far as I recall to replace the static string array (stopwords) in StopAnalyzer. \r\nDuring the refactoring / improvements in contrib/analyzers we decided to make analyzers and tokenfilters immutable and use chararrayset whereever we can. To prevent provided set from being modified while they are in use in a filter the given set is copied and wrapped in an immutable instance of chararrayset. At the same time (still ongoing) we try to convert every set which is likely to be used in a TokenFilter into a charArraySet.  Wordlistloader is not done yet but on the list, the plan is to change the return values from HashSet<?> into Set<?> and create CharArraySet instances internally. \r\nWith LUCENE-2034 we introduced StopwordAnalyzerBase which also uses the UnmodifiableCharArraySet with a copy of the given set.\r\nThe copy of a charArraySet is very fast even for large sets and the creation of a unmodifiableCharArraySet from a CharArraySet instance is basically just an object creation. The background is, again to prevent any modification to those sets while they are in use.\r\n\r\nbq. This new behavior also no longer matches the javadoc for the constructor. \r\nI agree we should adjust the javadoc for ctors expecting stopwords to reflect the behavior.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"created":"2010-01-07T19:29:25.595+0000","updated":"2010-01-07T19:29:25.595+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441571/comment/12797763","id":"12797763","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"Simon, I think yonik refers to this code in stopfilter itself:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n  private StopFilter(Version matchVersion, boolean enablePositionIncrements, TokenStream input, Set<?> stopWords, boolean ignoreCase){\r\n    super(input);\r\n    this.stopWords = CharArraySet.unmodifiableSet(new CharArraySet(matchVersion, stopWords, ignoreCase));\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nit seems to me that if you pass a charArraySet to stopfilter, no matter what, you get an expensive copy with \"new\"...?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2010-01-07T19:34:45.737+0000","updated":"2010-01-07T19:34:45.737+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441571/comment/12797772","id":"12797772","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"body":"bq.
