These are:\r\n\r\nosgi:service/jdbc/myDataSource\r\n\r\nresults in a NamingException. To work correctly first off we try looking using an interface name of jdbc and a filer of myDataSource. Since myDataSource is not a valid filter we get a FilterSyntaxException when we first query. This results in a NamingException. Instead we should ignore the exception so we fall back to a service name lookup.\r\n\r\nThe following lookup doesn't work:\r\n\r\nosgi:service/javax.sql.DataSource/(osgi.jndi.service.name=jdbc/myDataSource)\r\n\r\nbecause we basically do a split on /, so we end up with:\r\n\r\nosg:service\r\njavax.sql.DataSource\r\n(osgi.jndi.service.name=jdbc\r\n/myDataSource)\r\n\r\nhasFilter returns false in this case which means we query for javax.sql.DataSource with a null filter so we get the wrong DataSource (well only if there are multiple).\r\n\r\nSo two fixes:\r\n\r\n1. If we have more than 3 parts we shouldn't query with interface/filter but go straight to service name.\r\n2. We should ignore the / inside a filter, so we need better parsing that balances the brackets.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"167542","summary":"JNDI service name lookup bugs","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=not","name":"not","emailAddress":"not at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384"},"displayName":"Alasdair Nottingham","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=not","name":"not","emailAddress":"not at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384"},"displayName":"Alasdair Nottingham","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":1,"total":1,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12458985/comment/12844780","id":"12844780","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=not","name":"not","emailAddress":"not at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384"},"displayName":"Alasdair Nottingham","active":true},"body":"Both issues are solved, but I feel there must be a better solution to sorting out the problem with filters that contain a / in them.
