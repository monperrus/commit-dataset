It adds one new field which is the total number of operations completed for each interval which is required to show aggregate performance across intervals. It also does an append so that data points can be collected for each interval. Furthermore, the date foramt is now CSV so for easy import into Excel, R, etc.\r\n\r\nGenerating performance graphs can be generated in 5 easy steps:\r\n1. nosetests --tests=system.stress:Stress.insert &\r\n2. tail -f /tmp/progress_insert (just to watch and make sure it's working)\r\n3. fire up R (www.r-project.org/)\r\n4. w = read.table(\"/tmp/progress_insert\",sep=\",\")\r\n5. plot(w[,3]/60,w[,2],ylim=c(0,10000),xlab=\"Elapsed time (minutes)\",ylab=\"Writes / sec\",
