They are always sent when writing, but not required when reading.  The idea here is that we give as much information to the remote peer as we can, but if they do not know about a certain field, we don't complain that they don't send it to us.  As far as I can tell, this is what the old behavior was, so I think this patch should be reverted.  If you want Thrift to verify that a field is present, you should mark it required.
