If my theory is correct, then may be they were using 10.6 or earlier release. In 10.6 and prior codelines, we have following piece of code in BaseDataFileFactory.stop() towards the beginning of the method\r\n\t\tlong shutdownTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n\t\tboolean logBootTrace = PropertyUtil.getSystemBoolean(Property.LOG_BOOT_TRACE);\r\n\t\tistream.println(LINE);\r\n\t\tlogMsg(\"\\n\" + new Date() +\r\nNote, that we call istream.println(LINE) without checking if istream is null. This was fixed by Knut as part of DERBY-4873 but that fix went into 10.7. The fix was to use the helper method logMsg() which looks for istream being null and initializing it properly in case it is found null. I think it will be good idea to backport this change from DERBY-4873 to 10.6 and earlier releases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.
