that checks if the EmbedSQLException.getMessageId field is equal to the authentication error code in SQLState.java. getMessageId returns the whole 9-character error code (e.g. 08004.C.1) instead of only the first five chars returned by getSqlState, allowing us to check if the exception is, in fact, authentication related. \r\n\r\nIf the exception turns out to not be an EmbedSQLException, the pre-patch strategy of assuming the cause is an authentication failure is used.\r\n\r\nThe described method is used in two cases that previously only checked if the SQL state was 08004 and concluded on an authentication failure.\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedConnection.java\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/jdbc/InternalDriver.java\r\n\r\nChanged two uses of SQLState.LOGIN_FAILED where the causes of the exceptions were failed authentication. Changed these to use the more explicit SQLState for authentication error: NET_CONNECT_AUTH_FAILED \r\n\r\n\r\nI have started the tests and will revert back with results once these have completed. I attached the patch now in case someone wants to comment on the solution.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jorgenlo","name":"jorgenlo","emailAddress":"jorgen dot loland at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jørgen Løland","active":true},"created":"2007-09-07T13:00:25.585+0000","updated":"2007-09-07T13:00:25.585+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12377640/comment/12526086","id":"12526086","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jorgenlo","name":"jorgenlo","emailAddress":"jorgen dot loland at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jørgen Løland","active":true},"body":"derbyall and allsuites completed without error","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jorgenlo","name":"jorgenlo","emailAddress":"jorgen dot loland at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jørgen Løland","active":true},"created":"2007-09-10T08:19:48.471+0000","updated":"2007-09-10T08:19:48.471+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12377640/comment/12526394","id":"12526394","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=oysteing","name":"oysteing","emailAddress":"oystein dot grovlen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Øystein Grøvlen","active":true},"body":"Jørgen, thank you for the patch.
