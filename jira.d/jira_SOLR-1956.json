arbitrarily changed some packages to try to keep some organization.\r\ncontrib/analyzers had everything nicely organized under packages, but lucene-core and solr had them all smashed together in one analysis package each...\r\n\r\nyou can see all the changed packages here: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/dev/trunk/modules/analysis/CHANGES.txt?view=markup\r\n\r\nI think organization and
