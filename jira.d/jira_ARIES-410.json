This resolver is light weighted and always available though it has a low rank. Before our useful Aries resolver becomes live, it always grab jobs. This is why some tests relying on the real Aries Resolver failed sometimes. This is a potential bomb! We have to get rid of this service since we have a real Aries Resolver. I have verifed my fix and it worked in our local run consistently. However, before I deliver this fix, I need to deliver the fix for aries 411, which is to make blog samples to use Aries Resolver instead of the no-op resolver to perform provisioning.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=emily","name":"emily","emailAddress":"emijiang at uk dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Emily Jiang","active":true},"created":"2010-09-17T08:57:03.669+0000","updated":"2010-09-17T08:57:03.669+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12474302/comment/12910553","id":"12910553","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bartosz","name":"bartosz","emailAddress":"Kowalewski dot Bartosz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bartosz Kowalewski","active":true},"body":"Hi Emily,\r\n\r\nI haven't had time to take an in-depth look at the issue tha you're dealing with now (I don't know which test cases are affected).
