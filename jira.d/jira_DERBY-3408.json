I think the approach looks very good. Some small comments:\r\n\r\n  - The indentation looks wrong in utilMain.java. Probably your editor is configured with tab size 8 instead of 4.\r\n\r\n  - In utilMain.handleSQLException() the code that sets syntaxErrorOccurred is placed between a comment and the code that is described by the comment. Perhaps it would be clearer if the new code was placed above the comment?\r\n\r\n  - Some of the other tools messages have line breaks so that they look nice in a terminal.
