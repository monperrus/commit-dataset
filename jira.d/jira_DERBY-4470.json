This prevents UDTs from being used in contexts which involve ordering operations. Tests passed cleanly for me.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes a couple changes:\r\n\r\n1) Disables the logic which allows ordering operations on user defined types which implement Comparable. At a later date, we may want to support this useful functionality. That is, we may want to implement the SQL Standard syntax for UDT ordering (see part 2 of the Standard, section 11.56 <user-defined ordering definition> and part 13 of the Standard, section 9.11 <user-defined ordering definition>):\r\n\r\nCREATE ORDERING FOR typeName ORDER FULL BY RELATIVE WITH COMPARABLE INTERFACE\r\n\r\nHowever, that is an extra chunk of work which will not be included in the first rev of UDTs.\r\n\r\n2) Prevents you from binding a UDT to a Java class which is already used to back one of our system-supplied types (e.g., java.lang.Integer). This limitation patches around the problem that various parts of the code assume a tight correspondence between those classes and the system-supplied types. If we want to lift this limitation later, we must be cautious: the assumptions are scattered across the code and it is hard to think up a systematic way to find them all.\r\n\r\nTouches the following files:\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/CreateAliasNode.java\r\n\r\nSupport for (2).\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/TypeId.java\r\n\r\nSupport for both (1) and (2).\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/DataTypeDescriptor.java\r\n\r\nSupport for (1).\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.xml\r\nM      java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/reference/SQLState.java\r\n\r\nNew error messages.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nM      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/GeneratedColumnsHelper.java\r\nM      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/UDTTest.java\r\n\r\nNew tests.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2010-02-10T00:16:45.495+0000","updated":"2010-02-10T00:16:45.495+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443094/comment/12832132","id":"12832132","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Committed derby-4470-01-aa-forbidOrderingOperations.diff at subversion revision 908635.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2010-02-10T19:12:37.926+0000","updated":"2010-02-10T19:12:37.926+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-4470/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06tlz:"}}
