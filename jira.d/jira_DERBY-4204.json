So I think we could just as well remove the flag and rely on the isOpen flag to protect against dumping the same stats multiple times.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch (d4204.diff) removes the dumpedStats flag and makes close() always dump the stats if the result set is open. It also adds regression tests for this bug.\r\n\r\nAll the regression tests passed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2009-05-12T11:58:05.946+0000","updated":"2009-05-12T11:58:05.946+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424270/comment/12708882","id":"12708882","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed the patch to trunk with revision 774281.\r\n\r\nBryan, it should be OK to add a regression test based on XPLAIN to trunk now, either as part of this issue or as a separate issue.\r\n\r\nI'll leave this issue open until the fix has been backported.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2009-05-13T10:59:44.833+0000","updated":"2009-05-13T10:59:44.833+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424270/comment/12709202","id":"12709202","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Attached 'addXPLAINTest.diff' is a patch proposal which augments the test\r\nthat Knut added to additionally verify that the SYSXPLAIN_STATEMENTS\r\ntable sees 5 distinct rows when the statement is executed 5 times.\r\n\r\nI verified (by re-introducing the bug in my environment) that prior to the\r\nfix, the UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT statements only saw 1 row in SYSXPLAIN_STATEMENTS,\r\nwhile the SELECT and VALUES statements saw 5 rows, while with the\r\ncode change in place, all the statements capture 5 rows into SYSXPLAIN_STATEMENTS.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to the rest of the DERBY-4204 fix, this change should NOT be backported\r\nto prior branches, because the XPLAIN tables feature is only present in the trunk.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know of any comments on the patch.
