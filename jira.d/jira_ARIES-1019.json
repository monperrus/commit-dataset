Proxy weaves the class with the WovenProxy interface and adds the necessary dynamic package imports. JPA then gets called and uses PCEnhancer which, in turn, calls BCClass.getDeclaredInterfaceTypes, which ultimately calls Class.forName using the woven interface's name. The class loader is from the bundle whose class is being woven. Per the OSGi spec, dynamic imports do not take effect until after the entire weaving process is complete. Consequently, the bundle's class loader does not yet have visibility to the class.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to ensure that the jpa weaving hook is always called before the proxy weaving hook using the service ranking property.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"315283","summary":"JPA weaving hook must be called before proxy weaving hook.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jwross%40us.ibm.com","name":"jwross@us.ibm.com","emailAddress":"jwross at us dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Ross","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jwross%40us.ibm.com","name":"jwross@us.ibm.com","emailAddress":"jwross at us dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Ross","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":4,"total":4,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12634446/comment/13588534","id":"13588534","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jwross%40us.ibm.com","name":"jwross@us.ibm.com","emailAddress":"jwross at us dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Ross","active":true},"body":"I also opened https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-2342 for openjpa's consideration.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jwross%40us.ibm.com","name":"jwross@us.ibm.com","emailAddress":"jwross at us dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Ross","active":true},"created":"2013-02-27T17:23:30.519+0000","updated":"2013-02-27T17:23:30.519+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12634446/comment/13588761","id":"13588761","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jwross%40us.ibm.com","name":"jwross@us.ibm.com","emailAddress":"jwross at us dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Ross","active":true},"body":"I think the simplest and best thing to do would be to register the jpa weaving hook with a service ranking of Integer.MAX_VALUE.
