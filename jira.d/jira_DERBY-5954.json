Sorry for answering late, I have been out for a while.\r\nWhat we are looking for here is any \"<in-line window specification>\" in the sense of SQL 2003 section 6.10 \"Window Function\" contained in a select list (syntax rule 3b). The meaning of the in-line window specification is described in Syntax Rule 7-9 of section 6.10.\r\nPertinent quote (simplified):\r\n\r\n7) Let SL be the <select list> that simply contains[1] OF (the window function)\r\n8d) Let SLNEW be the <select list> that is obtained from SL by replacing OF by:\r\n     OFT OVER WSN (where WSN is an equivalent synthesized window on the table expression TE)\r\nRule 9 f) and g) describes how our in-lined window is transformed to be appended to any existing windows for the table expression.\r\n\r\nNow, earlier, we found window functions *not* simply contained in the SL, i.e. inside a nested SELECT since the visitor went to deep. The in-lined window specification properly belonged at the level of that nested SELECT's table expression.\r\n\r\nSo, Bryan's Criterion 1) is satisfied, in that the visitor previously visited *all* nodes contained in the select list.\r\nAfter the change we do not visit nodes *under* a simply contained (nested) SELECT statement. But that is OK, since any OF previously (erroneously) found there are not *simply contained in the outer SL.\r\n\r\nSo 1) holds I believe. Now, as for 2) could we (still) be descending into any subquery we should not (we obviously did before)?\r\nThat would need to be in a case where we had some legal syntax in the select list (SL) containing in-lined window specification *not* inside a SELECT node. Can that happen? Well, besides SELECT we can have a VALUES subquery in a SELECT list. But we forbid window functions inside a VALUES subquery, cf. this line in RowResultSetNode#bindExpressions:\r\n\r\nSelectNode.checkNoWindowFunctions(resultColumns, \"VALUES\");\r\n\r\nSo, since we now forbid the visitor to descend into nested SELECTs and any nested VALUES are innocuous, we can not find any \"wrong\" in-lined window function. So 2) also holds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A1 simply contains B1 if A1 contains B1 without an intervening instance of <A> or an intervening instance of\r\n<B>.\r\n\r\nMakes sense?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
