That is just a generic 'call this bean method' system.\r\n\r\nI think the story is that the interval came first, but we don't specify indexwriter anywhere in solrconfig, so it made sense to go where it is perhaps - and then later this generic system to call setters was impl'd, and it just happens that for a little while you could use it to set the termIndexInterval.\r\n\r\nI'm all for consistency if it possible though. So far, Solr has really avoided exposing an IndexWriter - it's not even part of the UpdateHandler interface. We have hacked around that here and there by exposing in DirectUpdateHandler2 and counting on that impl for certain functionality.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2010-09-12T11:34:23.856+0000","updated":"2010-09-12T11:34:23.856+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12473929/comment/12908450","id":"12908450","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"bq.
