When PagedBytes is created it is given a number of bits to use per block. The blockSize is set to (1 << blockBits). From what I've seen, classes that use PagedBytes usually pass in 15 as the blockBits. This leads to the 32768 byte limit.\r\n\r\nThe fillSlice function of the PagedBytes.Reader will return a block of bytes that is either inside one block or overlapping two blocks. If you try to give it a length that is over the block size it will hit the out of bounds exception. For the project I am working on, we need more than 32k bytes for our DocValues. We need that much rarely, but we still need that much to keep the search functioning.

Otherwise, I think we can live w/ the limitation and leave it for the app to worry about a workaround / write its own Codec.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2013-05-08T16:02:41.751+0000","updated":"2013-05-08T16:02:41.751+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618435/comment/13652014","id":"13652014","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"For the faceting use case, we have SortedSetDocValuesField, which can hold 2B facets per-field and you can have.... maybe 2B fields per doc.\r\n\r\nSo the limitation here is not docvalues.\r\n\r\nBINARY datatype isnt designed for faceting.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2013-05-08T16:04:46.700+0000","updated":"2013-05-08T16:04:46.700+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618435/comment/13652045","id":"13652045","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"I think we should fix the limit in core, and then existing codecs should enforce their own limits, at indexing time?\r\n\r\nThis way users that sometimes need to store > 32 KB binary doc value can do so, with the right DVFormat.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2013-05-08T16:43:35.362+0000","updated":"2013-05-08T16:43:35.362+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618435/comment/13652097","id":"13652097","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"bq.

Now, I know that isn't true.\r\n\r\nThe big difference is that DV fields are stored column stride, so you\r\ncan decide on a field by field basis whether it will be in RAM on disk\r\netc., and you get faster access if you know you just need to work with\r\njust one or two fields.\r\n\r\nVs stored fields where all fields for one document are stored\r\n\"together\".\r\n\r\nEach has different tradeoffs so it's really up to the app to decide\r\nwhich is best... if you know you need 12 fields loaded for each\r\ndocument you are presenting on the current page, stored fields is\r\nprobably best.\r\n\r\nBut if you need one field to use as a scoring factor (eg maybe you are\r\nboosting by recency) then column-stride is better.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2013-05-12T12:55:18.448+0000","updated":"2013-05-12T12:55:18.448+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618435/comment/13655998","id":"13655998","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"Quoting Mike:\r\nbq.

I see it now.  And I see that after I commented the limit check, the assertion was hit.  I didn't hit this assertion with Barakat's patch when I last ran it; weird but whatever.\r\n\r\nBTW ByteBlockPool doesn't really have this limit, notwithstanding the bug that Barakat fixed in his patch. It's not a hard limit as BBP.append() and readBytes() will conveniently loop for you whereas if code uses PagedBytes then you could loop on fillSlice() yourself to support big values.  That is a bona-fide bug on ByteBlockPool that it didn't implement that loop correctly and it should be fixed if not in this issue then another.\r\n\r\nSo a DocValues codec that supports large binary values could be nearly identical to the current codec but call fillSlice() in a loop, and only for variable-sized binary values (just like BBP's algorithm), and that would basically be the only change. Do you support such a change? If not then why not (a technical reason please)?  If you can't support such a change, then would you also object to the addition of a new codec that simply lifted this limit as I proposed?  Note that would include potentially a bunch of duplicated code just to call fillSlice() in a loop; I propose it would be simpler and more maintainable to not limit binary docvalues to 32k.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2013-05-14T20:41:05.722+0000","updated":"2013-05-14T20:41:05.722+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618435/comment/13657498","id":"13657498","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=barakatx2","name":"barakatx2","emailAddress":"barakatx2 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=barakatx2&avatarId=16254","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=barakatx2&avatarId=16254","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=barakatx2&avatarId=16254","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=barakatx2&avatarId=16254"},"displayName":"Barakat Barakat","active":true},"body":"Just to clarify, before 4.3 I was fixing the \"bug\" by changing PagedBytes#fillSlice to the first patch I posted in this issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=barakatx2","name":"barakatx2","emailAddress":"barakatx2 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=barakatx2&avatarId=16254","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=barakatx2&avatarId=16254","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=barakatx2&avatarId=16254","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=barakatx2&avatarId=16254"},"displayName":"Barakat Barakat","active":true},"created":"2013-05-14T20:51:23.834+0000","updated":"2013-05-14T20:51:23.834+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618435/comment/13657509","id":"13657509","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"No, I don't support changing this codec.
