So the most straight forward fix is probably to use a (Parsing) Formatter that stops reading before the milliseconds, and then add them manually -- this means two seperate SimpleDateFormatters, (one for parsing and one for formatting) but that's \"OK\" since we never said the existing one was safe for parsing anyway.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot
