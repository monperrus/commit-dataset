The key questions i wonder about:\r\n\r\n1) why was segments.get different when i ran my experiment? is that normal?\r\n2) Assuming i'm correct about their being an optimization to not open a new searcher if the commits are identical, can we make this same optimization work on slaves in the case of replication?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2013-04-02T19:02:22.494+0000","updated":"2013-04-02T19:02:22.494+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12640130/comment/13620148","id":"13620148","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"The slave will actually do a reload if conf files are being replicated - so it's sure to open a new searcher currently.

I did some more experimenting and confirmed i was wrong about this – from Solr's perspective a new searcher is definitely getting opened and warmed.\r\n\r\n...you can clearly see in the logs that an \"empty\" commit causes a new Searcher to be opened in any situation -- but when it happens on the master the underlying call to \"DirectoryReader.openIfChanged\" recognizes that the commit point in the directory is identical.
