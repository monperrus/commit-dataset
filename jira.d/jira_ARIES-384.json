This is incorrect, as the repository xml describing by-value bundles was not known by the repository admin, because the repository xml was passed to resolver directly instead of going through repository admin. When trying to use resolver.getBundleInfo, it will search the bundle from repository admin's known repositories. Therefore, it will never get it. The fix for this is searching bundleInfo from AriesApplication's get bundleInfo, which makes more sense for the application repository.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the current test passed is that the no-op resolver's getBundleInfo was manupliated and return the byvalue bundles, which is not the case for the real obr resolver.\r\n\r\nI will also use this bug to fix the potential NPE cases.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"167672","summary":"ApplicationRepository should not use resolver to find the bundleInfo contained within itself","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=emily","name":"emily","emailAddress":"emijiang at uk dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Emily Jiang","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=emily","name":"emily","emailAddress":"emijiang at uk dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Emily Jiang","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":1,"total":1,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12472245/comment/12920970","id":"12920970","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mnuttall","name":"mnuttall","emailAddress":"mnuttall at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mark Nuttall","active":true},"body":"Resolved.
