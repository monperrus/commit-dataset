It is now on the status for 3.0, no deprecated helper stuff anymore in these internal classes. So they can be used in 3.0 without modifications.\r\n- As the DirectoryIndexReader is not closing the directory anymore, the deprectated IndexReader.open methods taking String/File would not work anymore correctly (because they miss to close the dir on closing). To fix this easily, a deprectated private class extends FIlterIndexReader was added, that wraps around the DirectoryIndexReader, when File/String opens are used. This class keeps a refcounter that is incremented on reopen/clone and decremented on doClose(). The last doClose, closes the directory. In 3.0 this class can be removed easily with all File/String open() methods. I could remove this class from IndexReader.java and put in a separate package-private file, if you like.\r\n\r\nI would like to have this in 2.9, to get rid of these ugly closeDirectory hacks!
