ThreadA calls Table.open(A), ThreadB drops a CF in A, ThreadA then tries to mutate rows on that CF.  At some point ThreadB will cause that table to release() and its column families go away.  I'm not sure what the right behavior is in this case (loud failure IMO).  That table essentially becomes invalid and will be replaced in Table.instances with a new version.\r\n\r\nIs that a bad approach?  Possibly.  I was hoping to avoid having to discover all the states in CFS that I would have to account for when a CF def is mutated.  CFS wasn't designed from that standpoint and I think getting it there would be an onerous task.\r\n\r\nI think a fair compromise would be to mark Table instances invalid when they are released and have them throw an exception in apply() to indicate the reference has been invalidated and can no longer be operated on (I'm thinking in the context of renames, which are the most complicated, but this approach makes the most sense in the context of deletes).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gdusbabek","name":"gdusbabek","emailAddress":"gdusbabek at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070"},"displayName":"Gary Dusbabek","active":true},"created":"2010-03-08T23:28:02.240+0000","updated":"2010-03-08T23:28:02.240+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12457782/comment/12843067","id":"12843067","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gdusbabek","name":"gdusbabek","emailAddress":"gdusbabek at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070"},"displayName":"Gary Dusbabek","active":true},"body":"I had some more thoughts on this last night.\r\n\r\n>I do think that Multilock is definitely overkill.\r\nMy idea was to lock a table during a definition mutation in order to prevent a row mutation from happening in progress.

I still think we need this.  And I think a per-table lock gives us more availability than a global table open lock. \r\n\r\nYou're using a read/write lock already pre-Multilock (iirc), so the only time Multilock matters is allowing writes to continue in KS X while modifying KS Y.  Modification is rare enough, and over fast enough, that this isn't worth adding complexity for, especially when it's complexity w/ a performance penalty.\r\n\r\n(Again, it's worth pointing out that using double-checked locking in Table.open completely bypasses the lock for existing Table objects.)\r\n\r\nHaving talked about locking strategies I will now go back to arguing that this is a solution to the wrong question.  (If you are on that page already I apologize for continuing to beat that horse. :)\r\n\r\nRM.apply is very very performance critical.  I don't want to add extra locking there, especially not read/write lock which is more expensive.\r\n\r\nAs long as we are corruption-safe in the pedantic concurrency sense we shouldn't worry about mutations during schema modification.  (Hence, I suspect that we do need to single-thread these to avoid potential bugs w/ renames.)  The only op that is potentially problematic is a CF or KS rename, where ops that come in during the process can apply to the \"wrong\" one.  But the same thing will happen to ops against the new name that get sent a ms or two earlier no matter what you do locking-wise.  In other words, the client needs to quiesce that target himself anyway, so us locking during the actual fraction of a ms for the change doesn't really buy him anything.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-03-09T15:14:27.157+0000","updated":"2010-03-09T15:14:27.157+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12457782/comment/12843254","id":"12843254","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gdusbabek","name":"gdusbabek","emailAddress":"gdusbabek at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070"},"displayName":"Gary Dusbabek","active":true},"body":"It took all my restraint to resist the urge to grab Table.flusherLock during the Table.[add|drop|rename]Cf() operations.
