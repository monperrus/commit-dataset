The SQL Spec in section 6.1.2 says of explicit casts:\r\n\r\n\"10) If TD is a fixed-length, variable-length, or large object character string, then TD shall not specify <collate\r\nclause>. The declared type collation of the <cast specification> is the character set collation of the character\r\nset of TD and its collation derivation is implicit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that given no explicit rules for implicit casts, that they should follow the same rules as explicit casts. Does that sound reasonable?\r\n\r\nKathey\r\n \r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2007-08-28T15:25:10.586+0000","updated":"2007-08-28T15:25:10.586+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12373151/comment/12523268","id":"12523268","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.
