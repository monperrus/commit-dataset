If it is a new message, then the default English message is used when the new message is not changed in the other locale. There might be a problem if an existing message is changed so that it needs a parameter, but that is something that could be dealt with at the time that the new message is contributed. Otherwise, the old message continues to be used in other locales, so for a while those locales don't get the benefit of the updated message.\r\n\r\nIn past releases, the new messages were translated by one of the companies interested in Derby, and the new translations were contributed back to Derby at a later date that was after the original release. For example, the new and changed messages introduced in Derby 10.1.1.0 were translated after the 10.1.1.0 release and contributed back a few months later. The translated messages were then released with Derby 10.1.2.1 a few months after that.\r\n\r\nSo, please do go ahead and work on this if you like, and I think it is best to fix only the message in English. The translated messages will be dealt with at a later date.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"created":"2006-03-20T14:58:27.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-20T14:58:27.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12329621/comment/12371064","id":"12371064","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mayureshnirhali","name":"mayureshnirhali","emailAddress":"Mayuresh dot Nirhali at Sun dot COM","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mayuresh Nirhali","active":true},"body":"Thanks Andrew,\r\n\r\nI have modified the messages_en.properties and submitting the DIFF with this comment.\r\nI did clean and rebuilt my local binaries and tested my fix.
