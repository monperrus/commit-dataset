It would be great if you could remove the tabs from them as well.\r\n2) The test runs in both embedded and client/server mode, but it always uses ClientXid. Is that OK?\r\n3) If parseXid() used assertNotNull(str) and assertTrue(str.matches(...)) instead of returning null, it would be easier to see the problem if the test fails.\r\n4) Assert.assertTrue(xid.equals(rXid)) could be replaced with Assert.assertEquals(xid, rXid), which provides more information if the test fails.\r\n5) rs, stm and conn aren't closed.\r\n6) Using finally clauses to do clean-up might hide the actual error. If you remove try/finally, it will still do the clean-up when the test runs successfully (which it is supposed to do).

Perhaps you could add a comment about that in the test.\r\n\r\n> Shouldn't we write the tests more sloppy that also a garbage collection would be tested?\r\n\r\nDefinitely not! :) We have already tried that, and it only made the JUnit tests fail intermittently and randomly. The most common problem is that tearDown() is not allowed to drop a table because some open object depends on the table and hasn't been garbage collected yet. I think there are some tests for memory leaks which implicitly test that garbage collection work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2007-05-15T18:39:39.127+0000","updated":"2007-05-15T18:39:39.127+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12367259/comment/12496422","id":"12496422","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=julo","name":"julo","emailAddress":"julo at stroffek dot cz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Julius Stroffek","active":true},"body":"I changed finally to catch with throwing the same exception further even if another one occurs (the new one would be ignored since it is not the one that failed the test).
