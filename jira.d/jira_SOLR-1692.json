Should it be the same as for the regular Solr highlighting or should we allow a clustering-specific configuration? My intuition is that we should go with the former. Otherwise, we may lose the clear relationship between cluster labels and documents on the output, because the clusters will be generated based on a text that is different from what the user is going to see.\r\n\r\n* What should we do if the highlighter is not able to generate a summary? One option is to use the full contents of the field. Alternatively, we could use N (configurable) first characters of the field. The answer to this really depends on the characteristics of the data we may get. If the total number of documents fed to Carrot2 doesn't exceed about a 1000, longer documents shouldn't be too much of a problem, so I'd suggest the former option (use full field text).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stanislaw.osinski","name":"stanislaw.osinski","emailAddress":"stanislaw dot osinski at carrot-search dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stanislaw Osinski","active":true},"created":"2010-01-02T20:29:18.640+0000","updated":"2010-01-02T20:29:18.640+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12444503/comment/12795919","id":"12795919","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"body":"bq.

If main Solr highlighting is disabled, use the clustering component's highlighter settings.\r\n2. If main Solr highlighting is enabled, use the main highlighter's configuration as the defaults and let the clustering-specific highlighter configuration override the defaults.\r\n\r\nIf we do it this way, we'll minimize the chances of users accidentally performing clustering on documents different (differently highlighted) than those they will see.\r\n\r\nbq. Would be great if, Carrot2 could also just use the analysis that Lucene/Solr produces, that way it would be much easier to configure stopwords, HTML stripping, etc.\r\n\r\nThis one would require some larger changes to Carrot2 internals. We do use Lucene infrastructure for preprocessing (currently for tokenization), but I can investigate if we can extend that further. A potential problem here is that very often the set of stopwords you use for document retrieval may not work equally well for clustering. I've filed a [Carrot2-specific issue|http://issues.carrot2.org/browse/CARROT-606] for it and will try to come up with something.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stanislaw.osinski","name":"stanislaw.osinski","emailAddress":"stanislaw dot osinski at carrot-search dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stanislaw Osinski","active":true},"created":"2010-01-02T22:36:57.836+0000","updated":"2010-01-02T22:36:57.836+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12444503/comment/12872583","id":"12872583","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"Bulk updating 240 Solr issues to set the Fix Version to \"next\" per the process outlined in this email...\r\n\r\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201005.mbox/%3Calpine.DEB.1.10.1005251052040.24672@radix.cryptio.net%3E\r\n\r\nSelection criteria was \"Unresolved\" with a Fix Version of 1.5, 1.6, 3.1, or 4.0.  email notifications were suppressed.\r\n\r\nA unique token for finding these 240 issues in the future: hossversioncleanup20100527","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2010-05-27T22:08:16.515+0000","updated":"2010-05-27T22:08:16.515+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12444503/comment/13043647","id":"13043647","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"Bulk move 3.2 -> 3.3","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2011-06-03T16:46:18.758+0000","updated":"2011-06-03T16:46:18.758+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12444503/comment/13078615","id":"13078615","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"body":"Grant, what remains to be done with this issue?
