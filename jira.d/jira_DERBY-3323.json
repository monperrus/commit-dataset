Since this is not what is required (ie. we don't want to have to say in order to run Derby successfully you need to force gc() once in a while), can we remove the gc() and then fix the bug if the problem remains?\r\n\r\nEven closing the ResultSet has the feel of making the test pass rather than fixing a potential bug. Is there a valid explanation for why holding this result set open stops the table being dropped? If there is then it's acceptable to close the result set, but if the ResultSet being open should have no effect on the DROP TABLE then we are merely avoiding seeing a bug by closing the ResultSet.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"created":"2008-01-18T21:32:29.381+0000","updated":"2008-01-18T21:32:29.381+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12386478/comment/12560563","id":"12560563","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"The ResultSets were open and accessing the table and needed to be closed or garbage collected before that reference was eliminated.
