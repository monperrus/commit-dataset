Network server was giving NPE when system properties were specified without values. When a system property is specified without any value, the getProperty method in java.util.Properties returns an empty string. For the following network server properties (minThreads, maxThreads, timeSlice and portNumber), 'getPropertyInfo' method in NetworkServerControlImpl will pass this empty string to 'getIntPropVal'. This will try to get the Integer value and will cause an exception. To display this exception, 'localizeMessage' method is used. At this point, 'langUtil' which is passed to 'localizeMessage' is not yet initialized and this results in the NPE. \r\n\r\nThe patch does the following:\r\n1. Moves the call to 'init', which initializes 'langUtil', before the call to 'getPropertyInfo' method in the constructors of NetworkServerControlImpl.\r\n2. If the system properties are specified without values, use defaults for them.\r\n3. For 'derby.drda.traceDirectory' property following is mentioned in the doc - \"If the derby.system.home property has been set, it is the default. Otherwise, the default is the current directory.\".  'getPropertyInfo' was getting the value of 'derby.system.home' but not using it as default for 'derby.drda.traceDirectory'.\r\nSo the current directory was always getting used as default. Changed this.\r\n4. When I added the default for 'derby.drda.traceDirectory', the tests derbynet/getCurrentProperties.java and derbynet/sysinfo.java had additional lines for derby.drda.traceDirectory in their outputs. Since the directory listed is dependent on the test directory, I have sed out 'traceDirectory' lines for these tests.\r\n5. Adds tests to derbynet/testProperties.java.\r\n6. Fixes javadoc for 'traceDirectory' in NetworkServerControl.\r\n\r\nRan derbyall on Windows XP with Sun jdk 1.4.2. 1 test failed (derbyall/derbyall.fail:lang/ConcurrentImplicitCreateSchema.java). The failure is not related to this change.\r\n\r\nThis patch also fixes DERBY-613 (Intended location of network server tracing files is not clear.). Please review/commit this patch. I'll open a sub-task to update documentation with the correct default values for maxThreads, minThreads and timeSlice.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2005-10-15T08:48:34.000+0000","updated":"2005-10-15T08:48:34.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12311499/comment/12332124","id":"12332124","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Reviewed and committed this patch to the trunk.
