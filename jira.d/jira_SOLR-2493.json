For me as a non-Solr comitter, when I did this code with Robert last year, I was also really confused about the design of Config (and in my opinion this is a wrong design). We should maybe open another issue and separate parsing and value-holding in two spearate classes (SolrConfig and ConfigParser). If we would do this all is solved (see above).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2011-05-04T21:44:12.889+0000","updated":"2011-05-04T21:44:12.889+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12506129/comment/13029003","id":"13029003","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ryantxu","name":"ryantxu","emailAddress":"ryantxu at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ryan McKinley","active":true},"body":"bq.

But instead of relying on a monolithic solrconfig.xml file or .yml file, isn't it better to re-design configuration to fit a path/node concept more fine-grained (like ZK nodes)? It doesn't feel quite right to store solrconfig.xml and schema.xml as a huge string in the SolrCloud ZK schema. It would be better to have stuff like /solr/configs/configA/general/abortOnConfigurationError=false as a separate config node. Likewise /solr/configs/configA/schema/types/text_en to define fieldType text_en. The config concept won't need to be bound to ZK either. There could be pluggable backend implementations, where one could read/write the existing XML formats.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=janhoy","name":"janhoy","emailAddress":"jh at cominvent dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130"},"displayName":"Jan Høydahl","active":true},"created":"2011-05-05T16:42:29.357+0000","updated":"2011-05-05T16:42:29.357+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12506129/comment/13029433","id":"13029433","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Jan, I don't have any experience with ZooKeeper, but that sounds neat :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2011-05-05T16:58:50.927+0000","updated":"2011-05-05T16:58:50.927+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12506129/comment/13043605","id":"13043605","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"Bulk close for 3.2","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2011-06-03T16:44:58.054+0000","updated":"2011-06-03T16:44:58.054+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-2493/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i03kf3:"}}
