I also think it would be good to separate that from the goal of throwing exceptions for bogus arguments (as i fixed that for all analysis factories in this patch despite the ResourceLoader issue: all arguments are parsed in ctor and the inform() only does actual loading).\r\n\r\nThe challenge in fixing the ResourceLoader stuff is in SolrResourceLoader. when it loads these \"aware\" classes it only adds them to a list (it defers this), and then at the end calls inform() on everything in the list. I haven't looked into why this is, but yeah i would definitely prefer if this was a followup issue actually.\r\n\r\nI would like this change (throw exception on invalid arguments) to make it back to the stable branch, so I'll keep this issue open until everyone is happy with it. But in general we should try to split up issues for these factories into steps: its not easy to make these sweeping changes unless you either have lots of time or are ok with introducing bugs.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2013-04-01T15:52:31.383+0000","updated":"2013-04-01T15:52:31.383+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12638770/comment/13618881","id":"13618881","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"I committed this to trunk.
