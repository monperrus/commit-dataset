As things stand now, all ctors that don't take autoCommit param still default autoCommit to true.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could  flip the autoCommit default to false, now, with the new ctors (the ones that take a MaxFieldLength).  This may be better since you have to explicitly update your code, anyway, to switch to IndexWriter's new ctors and so if we call this change out in the javadocs, users are more likely to catch it.  Whereas if we suddenly flip the default for autoCommit to false in 3.0, since there's no API signature change, users may not realize this had happened.\r\n\r\nOK I like that approach better.  Are there any objections?\r\n\r\nbq.

This saves alot of merge time because those files\r\ndon't need to be merged if we are merging segments that all share the\r\nsame doc store files.  When building up a large index anew this saves\r\nalot of time.\r\n\r\nA cfx file is the compound-file format of the doc store files.\r\n\r\nHowever, when segments spanning multiple doc stores are merged, then\r\nthe doc store files are in fact merged, and written privately for that\r\none segment, and then folded into that segment's cfs file.  When all\r\nsuch segments reference a given doc store segment are merged away,\r\nthen that doc store segment is deleted.\r\n\r\nSo it's currently only the \"level 0\" segments that may share a cfx\r\nfile.  As a future optimization we could consider extending Lucene's\r\nindex format so that a single segment could reference multiple doc\r\nstores.  This would require logic in FieldsReader and\r\nTermVectorsReader to do a binary search when locating which doc store\r\nsegment holds a given document, but, would enable merging non level 0\r\nsegments to skip having to merge the doc store.  This is an invasive\r\noptimization.\r\n\r\nSo you can't separately control when Lucene uses cfx file; it's the\r\nmerge policy that indirectly controls this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2008-09-24T10:02:15.096+0000","updated":"2008-09-24T10:02:15.096+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404936/comment/12634151","id":"12634151","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the info, it did not know this!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2008-09-24T14:31:45.462+0000","updated":"2008-09-24T14:31:45.462+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404936/comment/12634456","id":"12634456","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 698932 on trunk (2.9) and 698933 on 2.4.
