But if it was detected later in the method, 0.1 would be returned.\r\n\r\nI think the first estimate is the best one, as it sounds reasonable that the selectivity is reduced (fewer rows match) the more columns we specify in the predicates. However, I believe it was a typo in the original code that made it estimate the selectivity as 0.1^(numKeys+1) and not as 0.1^numKeys. I've therefore removed both of the original heuristics and replaced them with one single heuristic which is 0.1^numKeys.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I think the original calculation has a typo, is that other places in the code we usually calculate selectivity in a way similar to this:\r\n\r\ndouble selectivity = 1.0;\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < predicates; i++) {\r\n    selectivity *= <selectivity for predicate i>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn selectivityForConglomerate, the selectivity is initialized to 0.1 instead of 1.0, apparently for no good reason. Apart from not being consistent with other calculations, it has some strange effects on the boundaries, like the selectivity for numKeys=0, that is the selectivity for TRUE, becomes 0.1, whereas it clearly should be 1.0.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the accuracy of the heuristic is probably not very important in this case. This will only happen if the compilation of a query happens to come to this code in the short window between dropping of the old statistics and inserting the new statistics. And recreation of statistics invalidates the query plan, so the query is likely to be recompiled with fresh statistics very soon afterwards.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2011-04-01T12:09:51.552+0000","updated":"2011-04-01T12:09:51.552+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12502389/comment/13015304","id":"13015304","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 1088495.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2011-04-04T08:01:44.623+0000","updated":"2011-04-04T08:01:44.623+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12502389/comment/13015703","id":"13015703","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
