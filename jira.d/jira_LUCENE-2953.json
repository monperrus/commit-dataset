I would propose the following:\r\nIn general the final T[] heap variable should be private to the PQ and used only there. For performance yonik wanted the heap[] protected and that caused the issue. As long as the heap[] array is private it can never be accessed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSo my proposal is to internally use the T[] as a private field and simply use another Object[] thats protected (pointing to the same array). This would fix the problem. The most correct idea would be to add a setHeapSlot(int, T o) and T getHeapSlot(int) method and hiding the T[] heap completely, but I know, Yonik will disagree :-)\r\n\r\nThere is some other problem: the heap array should be final, but it cannot, because of the stupid initialize() method. I would like to remove this method and simply move the code to PQ's ctor. I don't understand why the initialize() method is there, which is a problem: Every guide on Java programming tells you to never call protected overrideable methods from ctors, as this can break easily.

I remember using pq at some point for other things and hating that initialize method, so I'm all for it.\r\n\r\nThe inititalize method was only there for one single reason in Lucene (a hack): The getSentinelObject() method was used in HitQueue like that: it should return null for some special corner case. To enable this special case, a boolean field was used. But the ctor had to populate that field before the prepoulating in super() was done, and thats impossible. I changed that by adding a boolean ctor to the PQ base class to enable/disable pre-populating like HitQueue did before.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot
