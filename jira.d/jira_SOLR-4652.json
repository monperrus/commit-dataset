From within a per core handler (that is loaded within the core's lib dir), you grab the ShardHandlerFactory from CoreContainer, casting to MyShardHandlerFactory will results in a ClassCastException with a message like \"cannot cast instance of MyShardHandlerFactory to MyShardHandlerFactory\".\r\n\r\n2. Adding a custom dir for shared lib (for example \"mylib\") does not work.

I'll keep looking at it, but I wanted to get this up so hopefully others have some thoughts on how best to fix.  IMO, it seems like there needs to be a clear chain of resource loaders (one for loading solr.xml, a child for loading the lib dir, used for solr.xml plugins, a grandchild for per core config, and a great grandchild for per core lib dir based plugins).

I was also disappointed when I was digging into that several times, last time when working on Lucene's SPI issues.\r\nIn my opinion, the context classloader should be out of scope (in general, code that uses the context class loader as a \"default\" because no other classloader is there is buggy to me and may drive crazy under certain circumstances like different per-thread behaviour, e.g. in callbacks called from system threads).\r\nThe ResourceLoaders/Classloaders in Solr should be built on startup of the webapplication and should use the webapp classloader as root (and dont use context class loader as replacement for webapp classloader, just get it e.g. from inside the SolrDispatchFilter's init method like this.getClass().getClassLoader()). Any classloader created from solr should be a child/grandchild of this root class loader. The core container's resource loader should be the only child of the webapp classloader. Every solr core then should be a child of the core container's classloader. Also those resource loaders must use parent-first semantics as Java suggests (in that case its unlikely that you get class cannot be cast to same name...).\r\nI simply had no time to fix this, but I may be able to help. A correct classloader design is hard, but doable - and your issue confirms my problems with the current design.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-03-28T23:19:47.646+0000","updated":"2013-03-28T23:21:10.938+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639705/comment/13616825","id":"13616825","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"The crux of the issue is that solr.xml was never able to specify stuff like this before - so the entire design is still basically what we had when Solr was single core.\r\n\r\nAs far as I remember, shard handler started in solrconfig.xml and was per core. At some point, someone moved it to core container so that things like the thread pool could be shared across cores. At this point, we lost the ability to configure it - support was simply removed.\r\n\r\nMuch later, I needed to set some timeouts for freebsd blackhole reasons and I found I had no way to do this - so I shoved the shardhandler into solr.xml simply so I could set these timeouts in tests.
