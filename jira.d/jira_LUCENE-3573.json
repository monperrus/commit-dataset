I think that we should nuke refresh() and adopt the IR approach, even though I don't like the 'maybe' and 'if', might as well make the API consistent. So instead of refresh() we'll have a static TR.openIfChanged that either returns null (no changes, or the taxonomy wasn't recreated) or a new instance in case it was recreated.\r\n\r\nNote that unlike IndexReader, if the taxonomy index wasn't recreated, openIfChanged will modify the internal state of TR. That's ok since the taxonomy index was built for it: existing TR instances (that weren't refreshed) won't be affected as they won't know about the new categories (and taxonomy index doesn't support deletes) and the caller can use the same TR instance in that case.\r\n\r\nWhatever we end up doing, we should remove refresh(). Even though we're not committed to back-compat yet (it's all experimental), I think it is dangerous if we'll simply modify refresh() behavior, because users may not be aware of the change. So a new method is a must.\r\n\r\nBesides that, the test looks good.

IndexWriter anyway calls commit(null) in its commit(), so it's not an error to call iw.commit(null).\r\n** Same for prepareCommit()\r\n* I think that DirectoryTaxonomyReader.DIR_TAXONOMY_CREATE_TIME_PROP should be in DirTW since it is the one writing it. We also have this notion in other places in the code, i.e. TermInfosWriter declares the format constants, and other classes reference them.\r\n** Also, how about renaming it to INDEX_CREATE_TIME, since technically it is the index that has been recreated. This is to avoid confusion when storing this time in e.g. the search index's commit data, which we do in order to synchronize the taxo and search indices.\r\n* Maybe for debugging add a message to InconsistentTaxonomyException which will tell us that the taxo has been recreated + the recreate time?\r\n\r\nAbout the other comments:\r\n\r\nbq.
