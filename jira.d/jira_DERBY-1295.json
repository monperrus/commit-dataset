not fail when running in DerbyNetClient (also expected)\r\n* When running in DerbyNet, I found it failing with:\r\n\r\n1) testNextOnLastRowForwardOnly(org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.jdbcapi.ScrollResultSetTest)junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: expected:<null> but was:<XCL16>\r\n(assertEquals has been called with parameters in wrong order: expected is XCL16, not <null>)\r\n\r\nInstead of disabling the test in DerbyNet, the test code can use the method usingDerbyNet() to disable checking the SQL state. \r\nIn addition, use the method assertSQLState(..) instead of assertEquals(..), and move the sql state string constant into the recently introduced file SQLStateConstants.\r\n\r\nI have made these changes in my sandbox, and my intention is now to  upload the updated patch, run derbyall and commit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andreask","name":"andreask","emailAddress":"andreas dot korneliussen at gmail dot

positioned on the last row.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS\r\nCalling the ResultSet.next() method when positioned on the last row of a result set of type SCROLL_INSENSITIVE in auto commit mode causes the result set to be closed.\r\n\r\nCAUSE\r\nThe JDBC specification allows a JDBC driver to implicitly close a ResultSet when the ResultSet type is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY and the next method of ResultSet returns false. Derby also implicitly closes result sets of type SCROLL_INSENSITIVE when the ResultSet.next() method returns false in auto commit mode.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\nThe behavior of SCROLL_INSENSITIVE result sets in auto commit mode has been changed to comply with the JDBC4 specification. SCROLL_INSENSITIVE result sets are not implicitly closed when calling the ResultSet.next() method in auto commit mode while positioned on the last row.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fernanda","name":"fernanda","emailAddress":"fernanda dot pizzorno dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Fernanda Pizzorno","active":true},"created":"2006-09-18T13:57:59.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-18T13:57:59.000+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-1295/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06zw7:"}}
