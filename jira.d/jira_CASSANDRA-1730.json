RING_DELAY elapses, and B propagates the fat client back to A, and when B does remove it A will do the inverse.  Part of the problem here appears to be that the FD is adaptive and RING_DELAY is static, and since both occurrences of this I know of have been on ec2, I suspect somehow the difference between all nodes marking the client as dead has exceeded RING_DELAY.  Since by way of CASSANDRA-644 the 1h timeout for fatclients appears to have been chosen arbitrarily, I think we should reduce this to RING_DELAY / 2, giving justRemovedEndpoints plenty of leeway to prevent re-gossiping the fatclient to other nodes that have already removed it and evicted it from jRE.  Trivial patch attached.
