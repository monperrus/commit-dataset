To me I think this is a reasonable 1st step to addressing this\r\nissue, it should avoid most errors when doing large index builds on default linux systems.  I hope that \r\nin subsequent releases the additional changes Sunitha proposes in her notes can be looked at.  \r\n\r\nLooking at upping the default 1 meg in memory part of the sort should be looked at, this is incredibly small\r\nfor a large number of the system we are running on.  \r\n\r\nAlso putting each sort merge run in a separate file was the easiest at the time, but does use up a lot of \r\nfilesystem resources.  In any case the entire derby server should maintain some control on open files,\r\ncurrently the sort module can eat  up 512 open files per connections in worst case.  Some other solutions\r\nwould be to tie the open files into something like the open file cache in the store, or maybe just store all\r\nthe sort runs in a single file - i think they are written sequentially so may not be hard to do using existing\r\nstreamed file support in the store.\r\n\r\nm1_142:134>svn commit\r\n\r\nSending        java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\store\\access\\sort\\ExternalSortFactory.java\r\nTransmitting file data .\r\nCommitted revision 430578.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2006-08-10T23:02:57.000+0000","updated":"2006-08-10T23:02:57.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12347716/comment/12427374","id":"12427374","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=skambha","name":"skambha","emailAddress":"ksunithaghm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunitha Kambhampati","active":true},"body":"Thanks Mike for the commit.
