Normally the \"response\" field is included before the \"facet_counts\" field, but in my result it first returned \"facet_counts\" and then \"response\". This is of course a valid and semantically identical result object, but it causes SolrJ to fail with a NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this NPE is that SolrJ in org.apache.solr.client.solrj.response.QueryResponse.setResponse(NamedList<Object> res) uses a loop through the response components and right after encountering \"facet_counts\" calls extractFacetInfo( _facetInfo ). That method uses _results which is null if the \"response\" component has not been encountered yet. (It is handled and set a few lines above the call to extractFacetInfo).\r\n\r\nThe solution is to move the call to extractFacetInfo() on line 99 out of the for-loop. Please see the attached simple patch for the solution.\r\n\r\nI have also checked the three other initialization calls that are made directly after encountering a result (extractDebugInfo, extractHighlightingInfo and extractSpellCheckInfo), the problem does not apply to those because the methods don't access global fields that need to be initialized.\r\n\r\nNote: It would be great if this could be applied to a maintenance release as it saves people from running a custom build to be able to use complex search components with SolrJ.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"19142","summary":"SolrJ fails with a NullPointerException when the order of result components changes","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=t0mas","name":"t0mas","emailAddress":"tomas at salfischberger dot nl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tomas Salfischberger","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=t0mas","name":"t0mas","emailAddress":"tomas at salfischberger dot nl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tomas Salfischberger","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":2,"total":2,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12472365/comment/12987858","id":"12987858","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the patch Tomas.\r\n\r\nBy the looks of it, someone already fixed the NPE, but the code would still behave differently depending on the output order -- i've added your patch along with a note about why delayed execution is important.\r\n\r\nCommitted revision 1064386. -
