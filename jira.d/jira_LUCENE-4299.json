To me this is not a useful feature at all, no one has ever mentioned a single use case for this, and it just makes our code more complicated. but it is what it is (for this issue)\r\n# there is no way to discover these options for a field of a document, you have to do things like 'peek ahead' to see the first position of the first term is -1, or same for offsets (except worse, we used to allow anything in offsets so -1 might be an actual value). This makes the merging code really hairy, and tough on end consumers.\r\n\r\nSo I propose that instead of returning Terms for Vectors, we return VectorTerms (extends Terms), which just adds hasOffsets() and hasPositions(). e.g. lucene40 already knows this from the bits for the field/doc pair and just returns what it
