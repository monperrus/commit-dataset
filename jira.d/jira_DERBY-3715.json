This property can be set on the commandline for either RunTest or RunSuite, or in one of the properties files used by the tests. The property jvmflags when passed on at the command line supercedes the properties set in a suite's propertyfile, and those supercede jvmflags properties set in a subsuite's or test's propertyfile, because the 'highest' level properties are passed to the jvm last. Setting this property for a test that runs with useprocess=false cannot have any effect.
