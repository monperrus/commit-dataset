This change is NOT needed. The masking is only needed when we are getting back an integer from relevant bytes. Somewhere else (not in Mahout's code) I was messing the bytes up when converting them back to an integer. So out of caution I put this one. This particular change can be discarded.\r\n\r\n> The formatting changes are fine IMHO\r\nThanks. I set up the code template mentioned on \"How to Contribute\"\r\n\r\n> There are several other changes in this patch, is that intended?\r\nThere are 2 noteworthy changes\r\n1. Concatenating hash signatures in a sliding-window fashion. This makes sure that an item falls into as many buckets as number of hash signatures selected giving it more room for collision with similar items.\r\n2. Fixing test case in TestMinHashClustering - This was missing evaluation on last cluster.\r\n\r\nI haven't had the time to write up the Mahout documentation for this. Also I need to think about using the results in recommendations context.
