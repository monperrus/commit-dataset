An example of this is the web-facesconfig_1_0.dtd, whose inclusion is mandated by the JSR 127: JavaServer Faces specification.\r\n\r\nCode that is more substantial, more volatile, or not directly consumed at runtime in source form may only be distributed in binary form.\r\n\r\nBy including only the object/binary form, there is less exposed surface area of the third-party work from which a work might be derived; this addresses the second guiding principle of this policy. By attaching a prominent label to the distribution and requiring an explicit action by the user to get the reciprocally-licensed source, users are less likely to be unaware of restrictions significantly different from those of the Apache License; this addresses the fourth guiding principle of this policy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the source must not be included in Apache products, the NOTICE file, which is required to be included in each ASF distribution, must point to the source form of the included binary (more on that in the forthcoming \"Receiving and Releasing Contributions\" document).\r\n\r\nNote that works written in a scripting language without a binary form cannot be included in any ASF product under one of these licenses (see Transition and Exceptions). In addition, C-based projects may have difficulty using works under these licenses since they would have to deal with platform-specific binaries, rather than just distributing source that can be built on most any platform.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIn fact our use is exactly like described there: We dont ship with this file at all (its nowhere in any ZIP/TGZ) and so no derivative work can be created.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-09-25T23:10:29.380+0000","updated":"2012-09-25T23:10:29.380+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12609144/comment/13463331","id":"13463331","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"{quote}\r\nThe main Lucene Notice file does not need to be changed, as it is not in the binary JAR file.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI don't agree. its a dependency that we download if you use the source release. \r\n\"binary release\" doesnt even really exist, and is optional (i coudl put up an RC with just source: totally valid)\r\n\r\neither this CDDL shit needs to be in NOTICE.txt, or we should eradicate these dependencies.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2012-09-25T23:10:48.800+0000","updated":"2012-09-25T23:10:48.800+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12609144/comment/13463354","id":"13463354","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"OK, lets add it to toplevel NOTICE.txt, too!
