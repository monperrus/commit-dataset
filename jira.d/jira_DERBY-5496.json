This patch attempts to reduce the uncertainty about which test classes really will run on small devices.\r\n\r\nThe following classes still need to be built using the JDK 1.4 libraries. These classes may raise method invocation errors at run time if they are used on small devices:\r\n\r\n    JAXPFinder.java\r\n    ConnectionPoolDataSourceConnector.java\r\n    J2EEDataSource.java\r\n    DriverManagerConnector.java\r\n    XADataSourceConnector.java\r\n    XATestUtil.java\r\n    BigDecimalHandler.java\r\n\r\nIt may make sense to move these classes into a separate package so that it is clear that they require JDK 1.4.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what to do with BigDecimalHandler. From header comments in that class, it seems that people expect to use that class on small devices. But it calls ResultSet.getBigDecimal(), which is not a JSR 169 method. Maybe BigDecimalHandler should be re-coded to use reflection.\r\n\r\nThe org.apache.derbyTesting.junit package is built in two phases now:\r\n\r\n1) First we build all of the classes which WILL compile against JSR 169 and CDC/FP 1.1.\r\n\r\n2) Then we build the classes listed above, which require JDK 1.4 or later.\r\n\r\n\r\nTouches the following files:\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nM       build.xml\r\n\r\nAdded a diagnostic message to describe the setting of compile.classpath.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nM       java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/build.xml\r\n\r\nRe-arranged the build of org.apache.derbyTesting.junit as described above.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nM       java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/JDBC.java\r\n\r\nRemoved call to String.matches() which is not in CDC/FP 1.1. Recoded assertParameterTypes() to use reflection and to raise an error if you invoke it on a small device.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nM       java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/XML.java\r\n\r\nUsed reflection to access JAXPFinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nM       java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/JAXPFinder.java\r\nM       java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/J2EEDataSource.java\r\nM       java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/XATestUtil.java\r\n\r\nCorrected the names of these classes in their Apache license headers.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nM       java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/RuntimeStatisticsParser.java\r\n\r\nRemoved the calls to String.split(), which doesn't appear in CDC/FP 1.1.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nM       java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/UnaryArithmeticParameterTest.java\r\n\r\nAccounted for the additional Exceptions which JDBC.assertParameterTypes() can raise now.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot
