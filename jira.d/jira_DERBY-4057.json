Redo recovery after system crash\r\nis harder as the recovery happens with only the raw store running, so the normal post commit machinery\r\nis not available.\r\n\r\nTo solve this the raw store needs to \"call back\" into the higher level Access module to do post commit processing.\r\nThis is similar to what the raw store does during logical recovery, calling back into btree code to do search for a\r\nrow that may have moved pages because of splits or joins. \r\n\r\nI think simplest will be adding an interface to register a class with raw store that it can call when it does an undo of \r\nan insert.  Then building an access level class that can take the information raw store provides, funnel it to the correct\r\nconglomerate implementation, and do the appropriate work of queueing a post commit action using similar logic\r\nto what those conglomerates do today for delete.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2014-10-30T23:27:39.134+0000","updated":"2014-10-30T23:27:39.134+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12414759/comment/14203828","id":"14203828","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"Here is patch with initial prototype.

The intent is to make the space reclaiming process of\r\nan aborted insert to match as closely as possible the existing behavior of space reclamation\r\nof a committed delete.  The current system does nothing for the aborted insert case so that\r\nspace is often not reclaimed unless the user runs one of the manual compress calls.\r\n\r\nIn both cases it is necessary to delay any reclaiming of the space on a page until after the\r\ntransaction has successfully committed or aborted.  This insures that redo recovery of the\r\ncommitted transaction and aborted transactions will always succeed.  If we removed the\r\nspace of a delete before commit some other transaction could use that space before we\r\ncommitted and then the abort of the delete could find there was not enough space to put\r\nthe data back on the page. \r\n\r\nThe work gets queued after commit or abort.  Usually this work is then done async to the\r\nuser thread by the raw store daemon.  This is often an issue with some intermittent test results across platforms that\r\n\"expect\" some amount of space reclamation, but sometimes get different results.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2014-11-09T18:39:28.153+0000","updated":"2014-11-09T18:40:43.055+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12414759/comment/14206776","id":"14206776","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"This patch is an improvement over the previous initial prototype.
