Surely not so you can keep using the Writer? Surely not because it takes to long?\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can see interrupting is waiting for the background merge threads. Interrupts generally happen when something is trying to shutdown. Wouldn't you only interrupt if close was taking too long? Your still going to close your directory right after. It's not like you are going to interrupt a close so you can continue using the Writer? That seems like a crazy use case. At most, it would seem to mean, close faster if you can - not, abort, I still want to use you! ABORT ABORT!

If we remove the wait for merge/commit shit in IW.close(), we still have to wait for the MergeScheduler to shutdown.

We convert it to unchecked by wrapping with ThreadInterruptedException. But thats the wrong way to do. InterruptedException is checked, because on interrupting such a method that explicitely declares InterruptedException, you have to take care, otherwoise you hide interrupts. Simon already has a patch to cleanup (not yet committed, also addressing this issue).\r\n\r\nIf you have a methods that is defined to not be interruptible, like Closeable#close() [interface dictates!], you are not allowe d to interrupt. The correct way to handle this is to save interrupt status on entering method, then call the interruptible things like wait(), join() but repeat them on a new  interrupt (so make then non-interruptible). And finally reset the interrupt status to the previous one including new interrupts (see examples in patch).\r\n\r\nIf we would not have hidden the InterruptedException in IndexWriter's close() - he issue we have here would not be there.\r\n\r\nOne example also violating the close()-not-interruptible is e.g. NRTManagerReopenThread. If you call close() and interrupt that, the thread leaks because it no longer waits for it to finish. We have similar leaks in TestDocumentsWriterStallControl. This should be fixed by nuking the RuntimeExSubclass and handle all interrupts correctly (it's easy, you have to know how).\r\n\r\nI will open issue once this issue is
