Feel free to mark this as a duplicate.

In this case, the *thread name* contains Japanese characters.  If the thread performing java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection() has characters that cannot be translated into EBCDIC the above exception is the result.  If the thread name is changed to contain only standard ASCII characters, the connection to the DB is successful.  Note again, in my case, the connection URL is a standard connection URL with no i18n characters, something similar to:\r\n\r\njdbc:derby://localhost/database\r\n\r\nIt is only the thread-name that contains i18n characters.  I don't know why the client feels it necessary to marshall the client-thread name, but that seems to be the problem.  The fix for this issue is likely easier than 728 if the requirement that the client marshall the thread name can be removed (it seems senseless).\r\n\r\nFinally, just for the record, a typical thread name that tickles this bug is:\r\n\r\n\"Running-2 (MOTDバナーの設定 for 10.0.0.90@Default)\"\r\n\r\nIf the Japanese is removed from the thread names, there is no problem.\r\n\r\nThe workaround in our case was to change the thread names in our code to not contain Japanese characters.\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"37908","summary":"Unable to connect to network server if client thread name has Japanese characters","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brettw","name":"brettw","emailAddress":"brett dot wooldridge at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brett Wooldridge","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310090":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brettw","name":"brettw","emailAddress":"brett dot wooldridge at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brett Wooldridge","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12310050":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":20,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459231/comment/12846032","id":"12846032","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Thanks for filing this issue.\r\nMaybe we use the thread name in something we send in the protocol, but I am not sure why we would.

I think there are some problems with this approach:\r\n\r\n1) The javadoc for java.lang.String#getBytes(java.lang.String) says that the behaviour is unspecified if the string cannot be encoded in the given charset. So we cannot rely on that method to replace non-ascii characters with question marks.\r\n\r\n2) The String constructor should also take the charset name as an argument so that the code works regardless of what the system default encoding is.\r\n\r\n3) We should avoid printing exceptions on the console. I think it would be better instead to do a \"throw SqlException.javaException(agent_.logWriter, e)\".\r\n\r\n4) EBCDIC supports more characters than US-ASCII does, so this approach will also replace some valid EBCDIC characters with question marks.\r\n\r\nI noticed that EbcdicCcsidManager.convertFromUCS2() has commented out code to generate a question mark instead of raising an exception for multi-byte characters. Would it be possible to add a flag to re-enable that code and call the method with that flag when converting extnam_ to EBCDIC in NetConnection.constructPrddta()?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-03-29T07:41:09.387+0000","updated":"2010-03-29T07:41:09.387+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459231/comment/12850833","id":"12850833","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"As for testing, could we set the name of the JUnit execution thread with Thread.currentThread().setName(\"<string with Japanese characters>\") in setUp() and reset it in tearDown()?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-03-29T08:37:04.209+0000","updated":"2010-03-29T08:37:04.209+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459231/comment/12850860","id":"12850860","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=espinha","name":"espinha","emailAddress":"tiago dot derby at espinhas dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tiago R.
