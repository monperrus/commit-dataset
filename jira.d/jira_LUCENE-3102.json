Since the wrapped Collector may support out-of-order collection, the document IDs cached may be out-of-order (depends on the Query) and thus replay(Collector) will forward document IDs out-of-order to a Collector that may not support it.\r\n\r\nAhh... maybe we throw IllegalArgExc if the replay'd collector requires\r\nin-order but the first pass collector didn't?\r\n\r\nbq. It does not clear cachedScores + cachedSegs upon exceeding RAM limits\r\n\r\nHmm, I think it does clear cachedScores?  (But not cachedSegs).\r\n\r\nbq.

This check \"if (base + nextLength > maxDocsToCache)\" (line 168) can be relaxed?

Wouldn't we still want to try and cache them?\r\n\r\nOh you mean for the last \"chunk\" we could alloc right up to the limit?\r\nGood!\r\n\r\nbq. The TODO in line 64 (having Collector specify needsScores()) – why do we need that if CachingCollector ctor already takes a boolean \"cacheScores\"? I think it's better defined explicitly than implicitly?\r\n\r\nYes, I think we should keep the explicit boolean (cacheScores), but eg\r\nyou could mess up (pass cacheScores = false but then pass a collector\r\nthat calls .score()) -- that's why I added to TODO.  Ie, it'd be nice\r\nif we could \"verify\" that the collector agrees we don't need scores.\r\n\r\nI think there were other places in Lucene where knowing this up front\r\ncould help us... can't remember the details.\r\n\r\nbq.

Only thing is: I would be careful about directly setting those private fields of the cachedScorer; I think (not sure) this incurs an \"access\" check on each assignment. Maybe make them package protected? Or use a setter?\r\n\r\nGood catch Mike. I read about it some and found this nice webpage which explains the implications (http://www.glenmccl.com/jperf/). Indeed, if the member is private (whether it's in the inner or outer class), there is an access check. So the right think to do is to declare is protected / package-private, which I did. Thanks for the opportunity to get some education !\r\n\r\nPatch fixes this. I intend to commit this shortly + move the class to core + apply to trunk. Then, I'll continue w/ the rest of the improvements.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot

There are several ways we can achieve that:\r\n* Take a 'null' Collector and check other != null. Adds an 'if' but not a big deal IMO. Also, acceptDocsOutOfOrder will have to either return false (or true), or we take that as a parameter.\r\n* Take a 'null' Collector and set this.other to a private static instance of a NoOpCollector.
