Making the changes now.  I moved the bytes storage up to BasicDocMaker.java.  Added the copyright and am adding a test.\r\n\r\nWe may eventually want to store arbitrary bytes, too, but no need to now.\r\n\r\nI changed the property to be\r\ndoc.store.body.bytes which means to store the bytes of the body as a field.\r\n\r\nThe testing has already paid off.  I wasn't setting the params var correctly.\r\n\r\nCommitted","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"created":"2007-03-23T13:14:07.010+0000","updated":"2007-03-23T13:14:07.010+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12365313/comment/12483682","id":"12483682","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"body":"I updated the docs to be clearer abut the records counting, and also list the new task and property in the package docs.\r\nCommitted.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"created":"2007-03-23T18:02:29.870+0000","updated":"2007-03-23T18:02:29.870+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-837/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i050pb:"}}
