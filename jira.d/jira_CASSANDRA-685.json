The downside is, it will take an extra rpc_timeout latency before the clients start to get timeouts.  The upside is, as things unclog the messages that get processed will be fresh ones, so we are less likely to waste work processing messages that the client isn't even waiting for anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like to dynamically adjust stage capacity based on the amount of work that gets processed, rather than have a fixed value that has to be manually tuned.  Not sure what that would look like -- none of the Java BlockingQueue classes have adjustable capacity post-construction.  But, stage enqueueing is only done in one place (by the deserializer executor) so we can one-off something if we have to.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-01-22T05:36:43.941+0000","updated":"2010-01-22T05:36:43.941+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12445194/comment/12803740","id":"12803740","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"Another thought: there is tension between \"I want to make the client slow down, so it stops making things worse by attempting more operations against an almost-overloaded node\" and \"if only one node is overloaded for whatever reason (maybe it is doing compactions and handling bootstrap simultaneously for instance), I want to be able to continue if my ConsistencyLevel and ReplicationFactor allow it.\"\r\n\r\nAlso: reads are different from writes; a read against an overloaded node may just be dropped; a write should be HH'd.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-01-22T16:05:48.450+0000","updated":"2010-01-22T16:05:48.450+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12445194/comment/12834548","id":"12834548","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"note to self: cap CFS.flushWriter queue","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-02-16T23:32:53.033+0000","updated":"2010-02-16T23:32:53.033+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12445194/comment/12840272","id":"12840272","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kingryan","name":"kingryan","emailAddress":"ryan at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ryan King","active":true},"body":"Would this back-pressure apply to commit log replay?

control -- but make how we deal with overload situations better so we don't have the current potential for a vicious cycle of getting farther and farther behind while RMS/RRS executors waste time processing requests for which the coordinator node long since stopped waiting for:\r\n\r\n- uncap RMS and RRS executors.  instead,\r\n- MessageDeserializer will check recent RMS/RRS throughput and will simply discard requests that won't make it through the task queue within RPCTimeout (preventing memory pressure from huge task queue backlog, i have seen upwards of 1.5M pendingtasks on MD)\r\n- MD will tag requests with a timestamp as they arrive and RMS/RRS will again discard requests that have spent longer than RPCTimeout in the task queue\r\n- log replay will have to self-throttle since RMS queue won't be doing it for it (it would be nice to deal with this by adjusting the queue size but concurrent queue sizes are fixed once created)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot
