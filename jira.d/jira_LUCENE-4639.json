So I think we can avoid the retry counter for now?\r\n\r\nbq. What's this magic for?\r\n\r\nI have no idea :). I just copied the lazily init code that was in genTempFile. At first I thought it increases randomness or uniqueness, but it's not true. if two randoms return the same int in nextInt(), counter will be set the same. The division by 65535 and \"AND\"-ing with 0xFFFF is I guess to keep the number small and positive.\r\n\r\nbq. Use BeforeClass hooks or (better) initialize a volatile lazily.\r\n\r\nBeforeClass isn't good I think, b/c this counter is reset for the entire JVM, and note that baseCounter is served as the JVM identifier. Perhaps randomized-runner could expose a method which returns the JVM PID and we'd just use it?\r\n\r\nIf we go with the lazy initalization, then we're basically back to the previous code, which synchronized in genTempFile on a lock and did the initialization trick there. It wasn't bad, I just thought that it's a waste to do this sync for every file. I have an idea how to avoid the sync unnecessarily.

They pick a per-vm seed and then a counter starting from that. If you create enough files the counter will roll over to next digits anyway so they add the 10000 for aesthetic reasons more than anything. More: if the seeds for two or more vm's are picked close to each other they'll soon enter a tight race to allocate new files. This isn't something you want to reproduce, it's something you want to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe process of generating temporary file names should avoid conflicts with other processes and with itself. A congruential random generator with a long cycle should be more than fine to avoid such conflicts (the probability of picking an identical seed in the master generator is unavoidable but very tiny), I don't think there is any need to have a \"vm-identification\" string as they do in Harmony.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"created":"2012-12-21T07:48:18.199+0000","updated":"2012-12-21T07:48:18.199+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12624776/comment/13538985","id":"13538985","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"bq. I don't think there is any need to have a \"vm-identification\" string as they do in Harmony.\r\n\r\nI think it's convenient? Maybe if we change the runner/build framework to generate a truly unique work.dir for each JVM (see the email I sent to dev@), then we can remove it. I'll keep it for now, as it helps identifying which directories were created by the same JVM, in case you want to debug something (as they're not deleted on build failure).\r\n\r\nI'll remove the
