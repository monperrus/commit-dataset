The client already knows that values can be split, and handles that by sending a CNTQRY command to the server when it detects that it needs more data, but it implicitly assumes that each value is only split once. That assumption is valid currently, since we never send strings long enough to span three blocks. This changed with the server-side fix to stop truncating the strings, and the client stops sending CNTQRY commands too early, and there's not enough data in the receive buffer to construct the string when ResultSet.getString() is called.\r\n\r\nJust changing an \"if\" statement to a \"while\" statement in NetCursor.skipFdocaBytes() appears to be enough to get the client to send CNTQRY commands until the entire value has been retreived. This pattern is repeated in many methods in NetCursor. I think only skipFdocaBytes() will ever need to send more than one CNTQRY, even when the truncation is fixed on the server, but for completeness and consistency I factored out the common code into a helper method so that all of them now call CNTQRY in a loop.
