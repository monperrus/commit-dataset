When we first explicitly prepare a statement from the client, we make a note in DRDAStatement to which version of the compiled statement the prepare corresponds. Later, when executing the statement, if it returns data, we compare the current version of the prepared statement with the one current when the stament was compiled. If the versions differ we can be sure the client has stale metadata for the prepared statement, and we attach a SQLDARD block to the retiurned data. This is picked up by the client ok, it seems, cf the code in NetStatementReply#parseOpenQuery:\r\n\r\n     if (peekCP == CodePoint.SQLDARD)\r\n\r\nThe patch also updates the test  PrepStmtMetaDataTest to assert metadata for the result set after an ALTER statement.\r\n\r\nNote, DERBY-2402 also notes that before executing a query after the ALTER, the client's ps metadata is out of synch.

DRDA v4, vol 3 says that an OPNQRY command may return an SQLDARD object (see last paragraph on page 541). However, there are some variables in the OPNQRY command that controls whether or not to return it, so the opportunistic approach in the patch is probably not strictly adhering to the spec. Sounds like a reasonable extension, though, but it might warrant a code comment saying it is an extension (possibly also on the client side, so that no one accidentally removes the code that reads the SQLDARD object because the client code hasn't requested it).\r\n\r\nBefore checking in the changes, it might be useful to run the regression tests with a modified patch that sends an SQLDARD unconditionally, and see if that smokes out hidden problems.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2011-11-22T09:48:10.365+0000","updated":"2011-11-22T09:48:10.365+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12526969/comment/13155385","id":"13155385","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
