I think there are two things a user might want to specify:\r\n# What is the maximum distance detail the index should use for its calculations on this field.  In geospatial contexts, this might be 1 meter.  As applied to geohash prefix tree based Strategies this would result in using a particular maxLevels (geohash length) for the tree of about 10.\r\n# What is the maximum error distance for a particular shape that I am indexing or querying by?  It is bounded by the previous statistic.  I might want to specify this in real distance terms (e.g. 1 meter) or have it be some fraction or percentage tied to the shape's size, which makes a nice default.\r\n\r\nThese end up being hints / constraints; a Strategy will very likely use more precision but should have at least as much precision as is asked for.  Sound good?  If so...\r\n\r\nSo would SpatialStrategy then have a setMaxDetailDist() and setDefaultDistErrPct() (for index & query shapes) ?  The problem with setMaxDetailDist is that, as a setter, it's done after the Strategy's construction; we don't have an init() method.  It could become another constructor argument, the 3rd:  SpatialStrategy(SpatialContext ctx, String fieldName, maxDetailDist) or maybe don't worry about it -- add a getMaxDetailDist() that returns the actual maximum detail distance, and let initialization be up to the specific Strategy. I guess I like that best.  setDefaultDistErrPct() could be a simple setter with getter.  Supplying 0 implies maximum detail allowed by maxDetailDist.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2012-07-24T15:50:23.889+0000","updated":"2012-07-24T15:50:23.889+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12596737/comment/13421999","id":"13421999","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmale","name":"cmale","emailAddress":"gento0nz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Male","active":true},"body":"I think a couple of things:\r\n\r\n- Specifying absolute distance values e.g 1m, brings up issues of units.  If we use the units defined in the SpatialContext then it might not be clear what unit is currently configured when a consumer sets one of these distance values.  But also having to specify the unit every time sucks.  So I think if we're going to let users define absolute distances then we should use a single standard unit (km or m, I don't mind) and let consumers / adapters do the conversion themselves.\r\n\r\n- Absolute distances doesn't seem particularly useful when dealing with shapes of varying sizes.  1m might make sense for a small shape but seems a little crazy for massive shapes.  The nice thing about percentages is that they scaled well. \r\n\r\n- We should create a split between compulsory arguments and optional hints.  Anything compulsory should be a constructor argument and anything optional should be done via a setter.  If what you say is correct, that both of these are just knobs that can be turned but aren't compulsory, then they should stay out of the constructor but we should provide setters.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmale","name":"cmale","emailAddress":"gento0nz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Male","active":true},"created":"2012-07-25T04:53:01.191+0000","updated":"2012-07-25T04:53:01.191+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12596737/comment/13422017","id":"13422017","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"I agree on unit standardization.\r\n\r\nAbsolute distance error for a shape would be a useful option to specify to SpatialArgument as part of the query.  It only accepts a percentage (actually fraction) now.\r\n\r\nI agree with your concept of the ramification of optional vs non-optional as compulsory arguments vs setters.  So:\r\n* Add \"distErrPct\" distance error percent to SpatialStrategy with getter & setter, acting as the default for index & query shapes with area.  The non-PrefixTree Strategies ignore it since they use the full precision that a Double works out to be.  I think this should be one of those documented things (i.e. what does the Strategy do with it).\r\n* Add \"maxDetailDist\" (that name could use improvement?) with getter and setter.  Although again, non-PrefixTree Strategies ignore it and use whatever a Double is, but this time the setter is pointless because this specific strategy happens to require this information earlier as part of its construction.  Maybe that could be changed?  And I think it would be neat for the getter to return the actual max detail which will generally be greater than what you ask for.\r\n\r\nDespite these being used just by PrefixTreeStrategy, it seems universal in how you specify what you want, what your spatial precision requirements are.\r\n\r\nRE \"maxDetailDist\" name, maybe \"smallestDist\"?

Despite the \"pct\" it's actually a fraction [0 to 0.5].\r\n\r\n+1 Do we validate somewhere that the values are between 0 and 0.5?\r\n\r\nbq. Instead of SpatialArgs.distErrPct defaulting to 0.025 it defaults to null. Now the Strategy's own distErrPct (which defaults to 0.025) is supplied to args.resolveDistErr(...) so it can see if the args overrides the one in strategy or not.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, your motivation for doing this is so in the default scenario (when no pct is defined) you have the same value at both index time and query time, correct? I'm starting to wonder whether it makes sense to allow the value to be set per request.  Having the same value at both index and query time seems ideal so perhaps we should force the value, whether it be the pct or absolute value, be provided at construction of the Strategy.\r\n\r\nbq. SpatialArgs gains a \"distErr\" field, parsed from SpatialArgsParser. This is an alternative means that a search request can specify the distance in a more direct way.\r\n\r\nSo can the user now provide either the the distErr or distErrPct and if they provide the later, it is converted to the former seamlessly? Or must the user do the conversion themselves? I'm +1 for the first option.\r\n\r\nbq. One thing I didn't do, is move the distErrPct getter & setter up from PrefixTreeStrategy to the base SpatialStrategy.\r\n\r\nWhy would we want to move it to SpatialStrategy?  It seems unrelated to the other Strategies.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmale","name":"cmale","emailAddress":"gento0nz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Male","active":true},"created":"2012-09-05T14:04:17.704+0000","updated":"2012-09-05T14:04:17.704+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12596737/comment/13448784","id":"13448784","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"bq. +1 Do we validate somewhere that the values are between 0 and 0.5?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nbq.

I think it would be completely unworkable to have no query-time override and fix the percentage on the strategy.

The user definitely does not do any conversion themselves.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2012-09-05T14:40:36.720+0000","updated":"2012-09-05T14:40:36.720+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12596737/comment/13448801","id":"13448801","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmale","name":"cmale","emailAddress":"gento0nz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Male","active":true},"body":"bq.
