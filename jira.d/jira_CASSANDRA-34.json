This is a more fundamental question. If a column has a non-delete entry and a deleted entry with the same timestamp, which one wins? I don't think that we can rely on the ordering of the insertion/deletion. This is because the insertion and the deletion can end up in different SSTables. During compaction, FileStruct is sorted only by keys. Therefore, columns from different SSTables with the same key can come in arbitrary order. One solution is to modify CF.addColumn such that a deletion always wins when the column timestamp is the same. Not sure if there is any other implications, though.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=junrao","name":"junrao","emailAddress":"junrao at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jun Rao","active":true},"created":"2009-05-05T00:00:42.565+0000","updated":"2009-05-05T00:00:42.565+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12421771/comment/12705835","id":"12705835","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=junrao","name":"junrao","emailAddress":"junrao at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jun Rao","active":true},"body":"4.
