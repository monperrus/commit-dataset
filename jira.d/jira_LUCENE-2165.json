However, there is no constructor which accepts a Set, there's only the original String[] one\r\n\r\nThis is an issue, because most of the common sources of stop words (eg StopAnalyzer) have deprecated their String[] stop word lists, and moved over to Sets (eg StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET). So, for now, you either have to use a deprecated field on StopAnalyzer, or manually turn the Set into an array so you can pass it to the SnowballAnalyzer\r\n\r\nI would suggest that a constructor is added to SnowballAnalyzer which accepts a Set. Not sure if the old String[] one should be deprecated or not.\r\n\r\nA sample patch against 2.9.1 to add the constructor is:\r\n\r\n\r\n--- SnowballAnalyzer.java.orig  2009-12-15 11:14:08.000000000
