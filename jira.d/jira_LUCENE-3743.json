trunk)\r\n2. there is likely no bug in an random generator, instead its generating escaped &#FFFF;, the assert happens at 'tokenizer' level (after charfilters processing)\r\n3. trying to stop generators from generating strings like that is hard, especially since we test this htmlstripfilter 'chained' with MockCharFilter. for example MockCharFilter doubles characters 'randomly', and we test HtmlStrip *with* MockCharFilter too (a charfilter chain), so a random generator could make &#FF;, then MockCharFilter doubles the F's into &#FFFF;, then HtmlStrip turns it into FFFF.\r\n\r\nfor these reasons assume is the best, I added this as 'assert' originally because otherwise\r\nits hard to track down why some random searching test fails. if the generators were really generating\r\nthis character tests would be failing left and right.\r\n\r\nI dont think they are, I think its the situation described in 2 and 3 above.
