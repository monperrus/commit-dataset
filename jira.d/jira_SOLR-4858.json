update log with a sys property\r\n * there is currently a nocommit in SolrTestCaseJ4 forcing the sys prop to always be true\r\n * any tests using solrconfig.xml that have an explicit need to use/not-use updateLog override the sysprop explicitly\r\n * a few schema files that did not have _version_ fields are updated to include them\r\n\r\n...this still only scratches the surface of
