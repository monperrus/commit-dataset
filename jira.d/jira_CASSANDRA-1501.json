It's not a bad name per se, but renaming it back to timestamp would\r\n    ease migration for those coming from 0.6.\r\n  * Cli client doesn't remove fully reconciler and clock_type (in the\r\n    AddColumnFamilyArgument enum and at line 261, in the add column family\r\n    documentation). It's not completely necessary, but as is the\r\n    assert at the end of the switch in executeAddColumnFamily() is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe patch does not remove the clocks from all of what I could call 'the\r\ncassandra exported api'. I'm mostly thinking of:\r\n  * the avro API.\r\n  * the fact that DatabaseDescriptor.readTablesFromYaml() (and\r\n    RawColumnFamily) still tries to read a reconciler and clock_type.\r\nThe ticket's name makes it clear that it is about thrift, and if not done\r\nbefore, that will have to be tackled in #1502, but as it's not strictly\r\nspeaking 'internals', I thought I'd mentionned it (in particular, whatever we\r\ndecide for CASSANDRA-1502, those will have to be done).\r\n\r\nI agree that for CASSANDRA-1072, we need some way to distinguish between cfs with\r\ncounters and other cfs. But if we're just talking counters, and as far as the\r\nthrift api is concerned, it will be enough to have a 'Counter' cf type (and\r\na 'SuperCounter' one). Or, alternatively, we could user the validateWith\r\noption to distinguish counter cfs. So I see no reason why we shouldn't remove\r\nclock_type and reconciler in this patch. Modulo the (minor) comments above,\r\nI'm +1 on this.\r\n\r\nRemoving the clock interface from the internals is another matter, but I'll\r\ncomment on the CASSANDRA-1502 ticket.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slebresne","name":"slebresne","emailAddress":"sylvain at datastax dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630"},"displayName":"Sylvain Lebresne","active":true},"created":"2010-09-15T08:58:53.953+0000","updated":"2010-09-15T08:58:53.953+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12474083/comment/12909908","id":"12909908","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johanoskarsson","name":"johanoskarsson","emailAddress":"johan dot oskarsson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Johan Oskarsson","active":true},"body":"The discussion seems to boil down to performance concerns of having TimestampClock wrap the timestamp long variable in the standard write path.
