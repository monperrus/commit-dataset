So for SQL scripts that perform alot of DDLs (create table, drop table, etc.), I think this might affect the outcome of certain scripts master output, e.g.  fetching rows from system tables in an unordered way.  This may be one reason that contribute to the stated problem of this jira and may be problematic in general for adding future test scripts since each testcase in the suite is not starting with an initial database state (like the legacy way) but the database state of the previous script execution.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"created":"2006-11-07T03:45:11.000+0000","updated":"2006-11-07T03:45:11.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12354881/comment/12447624","id":"12447624","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"body":"CleanDatabaseTestSetup cleans up more than user tables, it drops procedures, functions, views, synonyms and schemas.\r\n\r\nPlease enhance it though to drop any remaining objects or clean up the database even more. :-)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"created":"2006-11-07T04:26:59.000+0000","updated":"2006-11-07T04:26:59.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12354881/comment/12447914","id":"12447914","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"body":"Ah yes, it cleans up more than just user tables.  My mistake.  =)  From what I see from the clean up code in the Derby JUnit utility class, it does a pretty good job of cleaning up all the user schema objects.  So it puzzled me why there would be an ordering diff.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that the ordering diff is on an error message that is directly related to the system table SYS.SYSDEPENDS.  The stored dependency entries that get populated are from the JUnit infrastructure (and not the script itself) during CleanDatabaseTestSetup.setUp() and its tearDown() method when it attempts to clean the database objects via its removeObjects() method and it made use of metadata calls to accomplish this.  Those metadata calls made to Derby are the following and their associated stored dependencies are populated in SYS.SYSDEPENDS (32 entries):  \r\n\r\ngetCrossReference\r\ngetSchemas\r\ngetProcedures40\r\n\r\nWhen those SPSDescriptors get prepared via its prepareAndRelease() method in the generate phase, the stored dependency entries are cleared out based on the dependent UUID first and then are populated again in SYS.SYSDEPENDS.  So based on this observation, there are row insertions and deletions in SYS.SYSDEPENDS in each setUp() and tearDown().  So the ordering of those rows when fetched in an unordered way may depend on how the store subsystem manages free space.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"created":"2006-11-07T19:59:25.000+0000","updated":"2006-11-07T19:59:25.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12354881/comment/12448238","id":"12448238","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"body":"Attaching proposal patch derby2048-trunk-diff01.txt to fix the ordering diff problem.  \r\n\r\nAdd an additional cleanup step(compression) to cleanDatabase() method in java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/CleanDatabaseTestSetup.java.  \r\n\r\nAfter objects removal is performed via removeObjects(), object compression is performed in the new compressObjects() method on the SYS.SYSDEPENDS to compact the system table.
