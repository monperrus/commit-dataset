Kambhampati","active":true},"body":"Background :\r\nIn Derby, when a stream is set as a parameter value, the wrapper stream object used for character data is ReaderToUTF8Stream \r\nand for binary data it is RawToBinaryFormatStream.Both these stream objects on read() return data in a format that is used to store the respective datatype value. E.g in case of char, the characters read from the user stream are converted using utf-8 derby specific encoding and read calls return \r\nthe data as expected by store layer. Beginning 2 bytes either have the utflen or has zeroes, or if it is a long string, then the value is ended with the special marker 0xE0 , 0x00, 0x00. For binary data, the stream data is prepended with 4 zeroes. \r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nonce,the stream has been read fully and end of file reached, further read() returns a -1.  If a stream is re-read, it returns a -1 which is incorrect data.  E.g.in the repro for DERBY-500, the update statement has multiple rows that qualify and since the stream parameter is used; the first row gets updated with the correct value and the stream is drained. For the subsequent rows, the read from the stream parameter value returns -1 and thus is updated with incorrect data.When retrieving the row back, the format of the fields is incorrect and thus the exception. \r\n__________\r\nThis patch\r\n\r\n1. adds changes to RawToBinaryFormatStream and ReaderToUTF8Stream to throw an EOFException if stream is re-read.\r\nIf a stream value has been fully read and end of file reached, any further reads on the stream object  will result in an EOFException. This seems reasonable and more correct than using incorrect values.  \r\nAdds a new error message - 'Stream has already been read and end-of-file reached and cannot be re-used.'\r\n\r\n2. changes to RememberBytesInputStream to keep track of the stream state and not call read on the stream objects once eof is reached.\r\n\r\n3. Fix a bug in StoredPage.logColumn related to streams. In one particular scenario, column was not being set to RememberBytesInputStream object and thus losing the data that would be read from stream into RememberBytesInputStream.\r\n\r\n4. adds testcases to store/streamingColumn.java and lang/forbitdata.java \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso note\r\n- This fix affects cases when a stream is re-used in which case an exception will be thrown. \r\nSo code that reads the stream once and materializes it will not be affected. E.g.  Currently in case of char,varchar,long varchar, streams are materialized and this will work fine as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nRan tests ok on jdk142/win2k (using classes directory)\r\n\r\nsvn stat\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\jdbc\\RawToBinaryFormatStream.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\jdbc\\ReaderToUTF8Stream.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\store\\raw\\data\\RememberBytesInputStream.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\store\\raw\\data\\StoredPage.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\iapi\\reference\\SQLState.java\r\nM      java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\loc\\messages_en.properties\r\nM      java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\lang\\forbitdata.java\r\nM      java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\store\\streamingColumn.java\r\nM      java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\master\\streamingColumn.out\r\nM      java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\master\\forbitdata.out\r\n\r\nI'll add clarifications to the paper - JDBCImplementation.html and attach it as another patch to this jira entry.\r\n\r\nCan someone please review it.

The SVN merge command  has conflicts in 2 files ( ReaderToUTF8Stream and streamingColumn.java). The reason for this is some changes went into these 2 files as part of DERBY352, but fix for DERBY352 is not a bug-fix but a behavior change and so it is not ported to 10.1 codeline.  As a result, I have had to hand merge these 2 files and so I am attaching the patch ( V10.1_Derby500.diff.txt and V10.1_Derby500.stat.txt).  \r\n\r\nThis patch fixes DERBY500 in 10.1 codeline, similar to trunk.  Also have added  comments in ReaderToUTF8Stream.close() to explain why reader.close() should not be called.\r\n\r\nI ran derbyall on ibm 142/win2k and there were 4 failures , none related to my change.\r\nderbyall/derbyall.fail:i18n/JapanCodeConversion.sql\r\nderbyall/derbyall.fail:i18n/iepnegativetests_ES.sql\r\nderbyall/derbynetclientmats/derbynetmats.fail:tools/importExport.java\r\nderbyall/derbynetmats/derbynetmats.fail:tools/importExport.java \r\n\r\nFirst two are master updates issue (not related to this change). Rerunning the 2 importExport tests in network server frameworks and running derbynetclientmats and derbynetmats does not have any failures. \r\n\r\nIf someone could review and commit it, that would be great.  Thanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=skambha","name":"skambha","emailAddress":"ksunithaghm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunitha Kambhampati","active":true},"created":"2005-10-20T07:07:35.000+0000","updated":"2005-10-20T07:07:35.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12313208/comment/12332644","id":"12332644","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Checked this fix into 10.1\r\n\r\nDate: Thu Oct 20 15:18:36 2005\r\nNew Revision: 327012\r\n\r\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=327012&view=rev\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2005-10-21T07:45:10.000+0000","updated":"2005-10-21T07:45:10.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12313208/comment/12332667","id":"12332667","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=skambha","name":"skambha","emailAddress":"ksunithaghm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunitha Kambhampati","active":true},"body":"committed to \r\n10.2  -  SVN 326307\r\n10.1.2  - SVN 327012\r\n\r\nI have verified the fix by running  a test. \r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=skambha","name":"skambha","emailAddress":"ksunithaghm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunitha Kambhampati","active":true},"created":"2005-10-21T12:59:15.000+0000","updated":"2005-10-21T12:59:15.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12313208/comment/12332668","id":"12332668","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=skambha","name":"skambha","emailAddress":"ksunithaghm at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunitha Kambhampati","active":true},"body":"This patch(Doc_JdbcImpl_paper.diff.txt) adds some clarifications to the JDBCImplementation.html paper.\r\nI used vi to edit this file.
