I frequently got lost in implicit properties (they're easy to persist and shouldn't be), what should/shouldn't be persisted (e.g. the translated ${var:default} or the original), and it was a monster, so don't think I'm nostalgic for the historical behavior.\r\n\r\nBefore I dive back in I want to get some idea whether or not the current behavior was intentional or not, I don't want to go back into that junk only to undo someone else's work.\r\n\r\nCreating a new core (collection2 in my example) with persistence turned on in solr.xml for instance changes the original definition for collection1 (stock 4.x as of tonight) from this:\r\n\r\n<core name=\"collection1\" instanceDir=\"collection1\" shard=\"${shard:}\" collection=\"${collection:collection1}\" config=\"${solrconfig:solrconfig.xml}\" schema=\"${schema:schema.xml}\"\r\n          coreNodeName=\"${coreNodeName:}\"/>\r\nto this:\r\n\r\n\r\n  <core loadOnStartup=\"true\" shard=\"${shard:}\" instanceDir=\"collection1/\" transient=\"false\" name=\"collection1\" dataDir=\"data/\" collection=\"${collection:collection1}\">\r\n      <property name=\"name\" value=\"collection1\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"config\" value=\"solrconfig.xml\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"solr.core.instanceDir\" value=\"solr/collection1/\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"transient\" value=\"false\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"schema\" value=\"schema.xml\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"loadOnStartup\" value=\"true\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"solr.core.schemaName\" value=\"schema.xml\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"solr.core.name\" value=\"collection1\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"solr.core.dataDir\" value=\"data/\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"instanceDir\" value=\"collection1/\"/>\r\n      <property name=\"solr.core.configName\" value=\"solrconfig.xml\"/>\r\n    </core>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, there are two questions:\r\n1> what is correct for 4.x?\r\n2> do we care at all about 5.x?\r\n\r\nAs much as I hate to say it, I think that we need to go back to the 4.3 behavior.

Here's my opinion.  Things that should be persisted any time there's a change:\r\n\r\n* Properties whose value has changed.  In the case of a rename or swap, that would be the core name(s).\r\n* Properties that are explicitly stated in solr.xml or the core.properties that is being overwritten.\r\n* Properties whose default value will be different in a future version of Solr.\r\n\r\nExcept as described in the list above, I don't think that unspecified defaults should be written.  When I took my solr.xml from 3.5.0 and put it on 4.1-SNAPSHOT, I suddenly had new data in my solr.xml after a core swap, the settings for LotsOfCores.

I'm glad it's going away\r\n\r\nWell, it isn't really, is it?  The point of persistence is to make sure that changes made by the CoreAdminHandler (creations, deletions, renames, aliases and swaps, plus splits and merges which are special cases of create/delete) are still there after you restart.  And this is the case both if you're writing everything into solr.xml or if you're updating a core.properties file.\r\n\r\nWhat would be really good here would be to split persistence policies out into separate classes, one for writing to solr.xml and one for writing core.properties.  For solr.xml, the only mutable part is the cores list - we can store the surrounding part as a plain String, which means a) we don't need to worry about reconstructing things from a DOM, so we're guaranteed that we'll always write out what we read in, and b) we can preserve things like XML comments.  The core.properties version just writes out any non-default properties, subject to the rules that Shawn outlined above.\r\n\r\nThe persistor (CoreDescriptorPersistor maybe?  Mmm, euphonious...) would belong to the CoreContainer, which can then call persistor.persist(CoreDescriptor) after each relevant operation.  CoreAdminHandler doesn't need to care about it, and we remove persist and persistFile as public methods of CoreContainer which reduces it's surface area a bit.\r\n\r\nCoreContainer, CoreDescriptor, CoreAdminHandler and ConfigSolr are all a bit leaky at the moment.

It's just that I'm pretty uncomfortable with the timing. Once 4.4 is cut, particularly if we can do something very quickly after 4.4 goes out and that discomfort goes away. Much of my trepidation is that there's some agitation for 4.4 in the very near future.\r\n\r\n\r\nbq (Mark): We are dropping all this persistence stuff shortly in 5, as well as support for the old style solr.xml.\r\n\r\nYou don't know how thrilled I am to be working on something that I _know_ is going to be thrown out <G>.. But I'm feeling like I'm earning the right to be the one who rips it out <GGG>.\r\n\r\n\r\nbq (Mark): But I'd be almost as happy if we simply got this working as a start\r\n\r\nRight, that's about all I intend to do on this. When 5.0 comes along and we'll rip it entirely out. So I'm looking at just enough to get by the current hurdles and declare victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the effort in what I did tonight was figuring out how to verify that all the nodes and attributes in one xml file are identical to another. Please don't tell me something's already been written, I looked but didn't find it. Of course what I made tonight is specialized to solr.xml and I suspect it has some holes to flush out as the patch matures.\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erickerickson","name":"erickerickson","emailAddress":"erickerickson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erick Erickson","active":true},"created":"2013-06-11T01:36:28.007+0000","updated":"2013-06-11T01:36:28.007+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12651823/comment/13680416","id":"13680416","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"bq.
