The one thing I didn't incorporate from your patch was the \"path\" parameter to the SolrVelocityResourceLoader (but rather hardcoded it), mainly for simplicity.  I don't think that multiple \"path\"'s capability should be done that way here.  Either your way or my way here is a change in how it was done before by requiring it look in a velocity/ sub\"directory\".  I doubt anyone has used it the way I was intending it to be used, so not a big deal to break it I don't think.  My thinking with that, thankfully quite useful in SolrCloud mode resource loader, was that plugins/contrib modules could ship their own Velocity templates in their JAR files.  Anyone using it that way will now have to put the templates in a velocity/ subdirectory inside the JAR.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ehatcher","name":"ehatcher","emailAddress":"ehatcher at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ehatcher&avatarId=22298","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ehatcher&avatarId=22298","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ehatcher&avatarId=22298","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ehatcher&avatarId=22298"},"displayName":"Erik Hatcher","active":true},"created":"2012-07-28T22:32:09.948+0000","updated":"2012-07-28T22:32:09.948+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599516/comment/13424457","id":"13424457","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=janhoy","name":"janhoy","emailAddress":"jh at cominvent dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130"},"displayName":"Jan Høydahl","active":true},"body":"I'm cool with that, thanks for finalizing!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=janhoy","name":"janhoy","emailAddress":"jh at cominvent dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130"},"displayName":"Jan Høydahl","active":true},"created":"2012-07-28T23:26:07.891+0000","updated":"2012-07-28T23:26:07.891+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-3648/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i03dg7:"}}
