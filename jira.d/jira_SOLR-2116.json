After some digging I found the problem, it is simply not loading classes from the lib directory.\r\n\r\nWhen no tika config is specified in the data-config.xml, the TikaEntityProcessor tries to load the TikaConfig in the manner specified below:\r\n{code}\r\n....\r\nString tikaConfigFile = context.getResolvedEntityAttribute(\"tikaConfig\");\r\nif (tikaConfigFile == null) {\r\n  tikaConfig = TikaConfig.getDefaultConfig();\r\n} else {\r\n....\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe problem with this way of loading the TIkaConfig is, that it doesn't use the classloader from the SolrResourceLoader and therefore not loading any jars from the solr lib directory. The attached patch resolves the issue that no content is parsed by Tika. I simply use the constructor that requires a ClassLoader as argument. I retrieve the classloader from the SolrCore.\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\nString tikaConfigFile = context.getResolvedEntityAttribute(\"tikaConfig\");\r\nif (tikaConfigFile == null) {\r\n   ClassLoader classLoader = context.getSolrCore().getResourceLoader().getClassLoader();\r\n   tikaConfig = new TikaConfig(classLoader);\r\n} else {\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nI haven't added a test that demonstrates this bug, since it only occurs when Tika libs (and its dependencies) are in the Solr lib directory and I don't know how to replicate this situation in the solr build. The TestTikaEntityProcessor class doesn't have this problem since all classes are on the normal classpath when the build is running.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=martijn","name":"martijn","emailAddress":"martijn dot v dot gronigen at gmail dot com-disabled","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Martijn van Groningen","active":true},"created":"2011-01-03T22:21:35.633+0000","updated":"2011-01-03T22:23:54.476+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12473639/comment/12977067","id":"12977067","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lancenorskog","name":"lancenorskog","emailAddress":"lance dot norskog at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lance Norskog","active":true},"body":"Great!
