These are ja_JP_JP and th_TH_TH. These are ill-formed in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47, these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave exactly as they did prior to Java 7.\r\n\r\nJava has used ja_JP_JP to represent Japanese as used in Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key ca (for \"calendar\") and type japanese. When the Locale constructor is called with the arguments \"ja\", \"JP\", \"JP\", the extension \"u-ca-japanese\" is automatically added.\r\n\r\nJava has used th_TH_TH to represent Thai as used in Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key nu (for \"number\") and value thai. When the Locale constructor is called with the arguments \"th\", \"TH\", \"TH\", the extension \"u-nu-thai\" is automatically added.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html\r\n\r\nProblem 2 was the assertEquals, I think like TimeZone we cannot guarantee this.
