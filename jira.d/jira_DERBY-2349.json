Only the last piece (what's written on the last overflow page) is written for the second BLOB column.\r\nThe same SQLBlob object is used as the source for both columns on input. Store updates the stream for this dvd to be a RememberBytesInputStream. During the insertion of the first column, this stream detects that the underlying stream (RawToBinaryInputStream) has been exhausted, and closes itself.\r\nWhen the stream is asked to fill itself for the insertion of the second column, it only has the last piece of the previous column available.\r\n\r\nI note that for the row trigger, the values are materialized and we don't run into this problem. However, materializing a LOB (multiple times) is a bad idea if it is big.\r\n\r\nIt seems we have several issues open that all have the same \"root cause\"; reading multiple times from the same stream. The difference is the source; (a) a user stream or (b) a Derby store stream.\r\n\r\n(a) User stream.\r\nIn this case we don't have a choice - we have to somehow store the user stream and then re-read the stored data. I immediately see two options, differing in performance and possibly complexity: write the value to the temporary area and use this as the source for further work, or write the value once to the store and then read from store on subsequent actions.\r\n\r\nb) Derby stream.\r\nSince materializing the value isn't a good thing for large objects, there are at least two remaining basic options; use of single stream with repositioning, or cloning of streams.\r\nThere are challenges with both. For the former we have to make sure we reposition whenever it is required, but not excessively. For the latter, we would like to avoid cloning unless it is required.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that would be nice for large objects, is the ability to let columns share the same field value representation. This may introduce a lot more complex bookkeeping, it requires investigation - and for this reason it sounds like a version 11 feature to me.\r\n\r\nThere are many things I don't know the details about in the store, so this comment is aimed at generating feedback!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2009-07-16T09:34:23.622+0000","updated":"2009-07-16T09:34:23.622+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363049/comment/12832458","id":"12832458","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Fixed by the combination of DERBY-4477 and DERBY-4520.\r\nVerified against trunk revision 980933, but it would be nice if the reporter verified the fix as well.\r\n\r\nI do not plan to back-port the fix(es) due to the rather signficant changes involved, but it may be technically possible.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2010-02-11T12:06:21.386+0000","updated":"2010-02-11T12:06:21.386+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363049/comment/13685208","id":"13685208","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"[bulk update] Close all resolved issues that haven't been updated for more than one year.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2013-06-17T09:19:20.970+0000","updated":"2013-06-17T09:19:20.970+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-2349/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06wl3:"}}
