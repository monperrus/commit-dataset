Only do this if the FromList is part of a SELECT statement, which is checked by calling {{FromTable.forUpdate()}}.\r\n\r\n{{java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/CursorNode.java}}:\r\n\r\n* Remove the MIN_SELECT_PRIV privilege collection, since that's now performed on a lower level (in FromList).\r\n* Create a separate method for the automatic index statistics update machinery, which previously had piggybacked on the now removed privilege collection code.\r\n\r\n{{java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/QueryTreeNode.java}}:\r\n\r\n* Reduce visibility of a flag used by the privilege collection code in FromList. Non-essential change.\r\n\r\n{{java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/CompilerContextImpl.java}}:\r\n\r\n* Non-essential changes/optimizations in {{addRequiredColumnPriv()}} and {{addRequiredTablePriv()}}:\r\n** Simplify HashMap access:\r\n*** Use {{HashMap.containsKey()}} instead of checking if {{HashMap.get()}} returns null.\r\n*** Remove redundant checking of a key's existence before calling {{HashMap.remove()}}.\r\n** Skip adding SELECT_MIN_PRIV if we've already added a table-level SELECT_PRIV on the same table (for symmetry, since we already have code to remove existing SELECT_MIN_PRIV if we later add SELECT_PRIV on the same table).\r\n\r\n{{java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/GrantRevokeDDLTest.java}}:\r\n\r\n* Add more test cases to the existing test for DERBY-4191 to verify that minimum select privileges are checked in subqueries.\r\n\r\nAll regression tests ran cleanly with the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot
