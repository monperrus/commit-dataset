During code generation we recognize that the SELECT has all constants and thus that its result set is \"reusable\"; see ProjectRestrictNode.generateMinion(), esp. the call to:\r\n\r\n  mb.push(resultColumns.reusableResult());\r\n\r\nAt execution, ProjectResrictResultSet sees that it can reuse the result set so it \"caches\" the execution row in doProjection() and then just returns that on subsequent calls.  However, when returning the cached row, the method does *not* call \"setCurrentRow()\" with the cached row.  In some cases (esp. left outer join) that can mean that the \"current execution row\" corresponding to the ProjectRestrictResultSet remains null when it should be set to the cached row.  Thus when it comes time to evaluate the ON predicate, which references the ProjectRestrictResultSet's execution row, the predicate fails with an NPE because the \"current execution row\" is not set for that PRRS.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a quick change that resolves the reported NPE.  I have *not* run any tests on this, so it's not for commit (yet).  I don't think I'll have much time to follow-up with this anytime soon, so if anyone out there can pick it up and take it to completion, that'd be great...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2008-03-14T05:37:16.185+0000","updated":"2008-03-14T05:37:16.185+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391406/comment/12578635","id":"12578635","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thomanie","name":"thomanie","emailAddress":"thomas dot nielsen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Nielsen","active":true},"body":"Patch, comments and explaination is very good.\r\n\r\nRunning some tests on it now.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thomanie","name":"thomanie","emailAddress":"thomas dot nielsen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Nielsen","active":true},"created":"2008-03-14T07:57:40.460+0000","updated":"2008-03-14T07:57:40.460+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391406/comment/12579519","id":"12579519","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Here is the patch with a test added.
