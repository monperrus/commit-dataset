That initialization code was guarded by a boolean flag to make sure it only ran once. This worked fine for the methods that were synchronized. However, those methods that weren't synchronized (like getConnection()) could end up concluding that no initialization was necessary and go ahead, just because some other thread was about to start the initialization. For example, a call to getConnection() could go through the list of available drivers without initializing it first, which would result in the \"No suitable driver found\" exception reported in this issue.\r\n\r\nAfter the change, the initialization code lives in a static initializer which runs exactly once when the class is loaded, so the list of available drivers is always ready before getConnection() gets to run the first time.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2013-01-24T08:23:26.273+0000","updated":"2013-01-24T08:23:26.273+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443668/comment/13561536","id":"13561536","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"The attached patch adds a test case that verifies that concurrent autoloading of the Derby engine isn't a problem on Java 7 and newer.\r\n\r\nI intend to close this issue as invalid once the test case has been checked in.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2013-01-24T10:12:38.325+0000","updated":"2013-01-24T10:12:38.325+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443668/comment/13562452","id":"13562452","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
