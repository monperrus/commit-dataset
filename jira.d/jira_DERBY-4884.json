See comment in its suite() method.\r\n\r\n- DeadlockModeTest: Same problem as BlobClob4BlobTest. It wraps a DatabasePropertyTestSetup on top of the encryption decorator. But since the encryption decorator creates a single-use database, the DBPTS will work on the wrong database (it works on the default db since it's not inside the encryption decorator). Moving the encryption decorator outside the the DBPTS will make the rebooting of the fail because the boot password isn't available outside the encryption decorator's setUp() method. Unlike the problem in BlobClob4BlobTest, this doesn't usually make the test take unnecessarily long time, since the test isn't expected to experience timeouts or deadlocks.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a patch that makes the encryption decorator better integrated with the test framework.

This will make all DataSource-based connectors use the connection attributes.\r\n\r\n- Decorator: Use a ChangeConfigurationSetup that adds connection attributes to the current configuration when decorating encryption tests (and, because of code sharing, also collation tests). Stop creating the database in the decorator's setUp(), since the other changes makes the framework create the database automatically on the first connection attempt, just like other tests/decorators.\r\n\r\n- DatabaseMetaDataTest: Work-around for DERBY-4886. Since the framework changes makes openDefaultConnection() use the extra connection attributes, and DatabaseMetaDataTest is invoked by CollationTest with extra attributes, the test of getURL() in DatabaseMetaDataTest will see a different URL in client mode.\r\n\r\nRegression tests ran cleanly with the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-11-05T12:01:35.130+0000","updated":"2010-11-05T12:01:35.130+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12479079/comment/12929498","id":"12929498","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 1032485.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-11-08T08:23:25.708+0000","updated":"2010-11-08T08:23:25.708+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12479079/comment/12929536","id":"12929536","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Here's a second patch that makes BlobClob4BlobTest and DeadlockModeTest use the reduced timeouts when running against encrypted databases. The patch changes the order of the decorators so that the DatabasePropertyTestSetup executes inside the encryption decorator, and this ensures that it works on the encrypted database instead of on the default database.\r\n\r\nDeadlockModeTest had one more problem that needed to be fixed. The encrypted variant always worked on the default (non-encrypted) database, not only when setting the timeouts, but also when doing database operations in the test case. The reason for this was that all the database connections were opened in helper threads, and the decorators only change the test configuration for the current thread (in a thread local field in TestConfiguration), so the connections would always be opened against the default database. I therefore made the test open all the connections in the main JUnit thread and pass the Connection objects as arguments to the helper threads when creating them.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, the time to run BlobClob4BlobTest was reduced from 5 min 25 sec to 1 min 40 sec in my environment. (No change in run time for DeadlockModeTest since it doesn't usually see lock timeouts.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-11-08T10:23:11.826+0000","updated":"2010-11-08T10:23:11.826+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12479079/comment/12930071","id":"12930071","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 1032907.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-11-09T10:18:29.978+0000","updated":"2010-11-09T10:18:29.978+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-4884/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06ua7:"}}
