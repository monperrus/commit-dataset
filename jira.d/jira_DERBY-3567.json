As far as I can tell, both may be waiting for a log send to complete, but only one thread will be notified when the sending has been completed.  Since, forceFlushed is then false, no further notification may be done.  Hence, the second thread may time out and cause replication to be stopped.\r\n\r\nI do not think it will work to just switch to notifyAll, since it is not guaranteed that a single write is sufficient to have space for all waiting threads to write their log records.  Instead, I suggest that notify can be called after every send, regardless of whether anyone may be waiting or not.  I am not sure the extra synchronization overhead will be big since the current solution involves access to a volatile variable anyway.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=oysteing","name":"oysteing","emailAddress":"oystein dot grovlen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Øystein Grøvlen","active":true},"created":"2008-04-02T11:40:38.701+0000","updated":"2008-04-02T11:40:38.701+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392235/comment/12584545","id":"12584545","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=oysteing","name":"oysteing","emailAddress":"oystein dot grovlen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Øystein Grøvlen","active":true},"body":"I discovered that my scenario with multiple waiting threads are not possible since calls to appendLog is protected by logFileSemaphore in LogAccessFile.
