issues that:\r\n 1. Modify this interface to use it to make the reading half of compactions memory efficient (almost exactly like the Slice/Scanner API I submitted for 674)\r\n 2. Add the new file format (with the next Scanner/Reader subclasses) to make the writing half of compaction memory efficient.\r\n\r\nI'd like to try and submit the first issue tonight (pending fixing one nagging bug).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"created":"2010-03-01T23:17:58.412+0000","updated":"2010-03-01T23:17:58.412+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12455590/comment/12839930","id":"12839930","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"body":"Sorry, I didn't really answer your question.
