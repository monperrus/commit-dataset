Now it has been changed to test for arbitary length strings. \r\n\r\n4) But as a specific test for this bug I can add the repro attached with this issue as a test case. Since the chunk size is 256 I could probably add test \r\n    cases to test for a range of chunk sizes like 0-256, 256-512.... But IMHO the existing test case and the repro(if required) should be good enough.\r\n\r\n5) From my knowledge of tracing this algorithm it would work irrespective of the number 256\r\n\r\n6) I however do not know if 256 is something like a most efficient chunk size. I mean the algorithm works most efficiently if your chunk size is 256.
