I am able to reproduce the diff on my machine,  but don't understand where it comes from.  Since the optimizer is choosing the same join order for all platforms, I was assuming the row order should be the same, as well--but that's apparently not a safe assumption.  I did notice that the queries that are failing have \"DISTINCT\" in them, so it's possible that the ordering of rows based on a DISTINCT is JVM-dependent somehow, which would explain this diff.\r\n\r\nCan anyone confirm that one way or the other?\r\n\r\nIf this is just an _acceptable_ difference in JVM behavior, then there are two possible solutions here: either 1) create a wsdd-specific master, or 2) (and probably more preferably) add an \"order by\" clause to the queries in question to ensure that we get the same row order across JVMs.\r\n\r\nIf, however, this difference in row order seems like incorrect behavior, then this would of course merit further investigation.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any input one way or the other?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"created":"2006-03-14T09:04:50.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-14T09:04:50.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12330233/comment/12370544","id":"12370544","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"body":"Based on comments from Satheesh and Mike at this thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.db.derby.devel/16656\r\n\r\nit seems like there is agreement that the resolution for this diff is to simply add an \"ORDER BY\" clause to the affected queries.  The attached patch does just that.  Note that the diffs might seem larger than expected, but that's because the order by has added a level of nesting to the query plan, which affects spacing and hence creates a larger diff.\r\n\r\nI ran lang/subquery.sql and lang/predicatePushdown.sql against IBM wsdd5.6, IBM 1.4.2, and Sun 1.5 and both tests passed for all three JVMs.\r\n\r\nThere are no code changes in this patch, so if a committer could look it over and commit, that'd be great. \r\n\r\nThanks again to Mike for the input/explanation of what was going on here.
