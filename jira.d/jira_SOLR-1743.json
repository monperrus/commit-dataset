We don't handle that setting correctly with MultiCore - we check it by iterating through all of the cores that loaded - but a core with a config erorr wouldn't have loaded ... so abortOnConfigError gets read as false when it should be true.\r\n\r\nSo we can fix that, but if you *don't* want to abortOnConfiguration error, your still going to see this confusing message, so we should prob improve

that in 1.4 a single core malformed solrconfig.xml (ie: garbage in the prolog) would generate a good error message -- and with your latest patch it still generates the \"missind core name\"
