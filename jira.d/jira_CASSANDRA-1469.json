But changing these to be aggressive can cause the same problem: most servers enable swap out of the box, so asking for a 4GB or 8GB heap could allocate happily but also cause problems when it starts paging.\r\n\r\nProposed solution is to update the start script to set Xmx to half of system ram (\"free -m | awk '/Mem:/ {print $2}'\").  Memtable defaults will have to be handled by Java, but we can do that based on heap size (Runtime.maxMemory).\r\n\r\nAn alternative suggestion was to provide \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\" configurations, but this plays poorly with rpm and deb packages.  I think the adaptive approach is more promising.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12454569","id":"12454569","filename":"0001_adaptively_determine_heap_size.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandon.williams","name":"brandon.williams","emailAddress":"driftx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054"},"displayName":"Brandon Williams","active":true},"created":"2010-09-14T19:08:03.362+0000","size":1120,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12454569/0001_adaptively_determine_heap_size.txt"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12454606","id":"12454606","filename":"0002_determine_memtable_thresholds_at_runtime.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandon.williams","name":"brandon.williams","emailAddress":"driftx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054"},"displayName":"Brandon Williams","active":true},"created":"2010-09-14T22:17:28.158+0000","size":2156,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12454606/0002_determine_memtable_thresholds_at_runtime.txt"}],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"92281","summary":"adaptive default heap size","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"customfield_12311420":null,"customfield_12311421":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":15,"total":15,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12473310/comment/12906351","id":"12906351","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mdennis","name":"mdennis","emailAddress":"mdennis at riptano dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matthew F.
