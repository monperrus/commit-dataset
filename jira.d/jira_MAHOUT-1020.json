Evidently, something in CDbw has become broken and you are the first to notice. When I run TestCDbwEvaluator, the values for k-means and fuzzy-k are clearly incorrect. The values for Canopy, MeanShift and Dirichlet are not so obviously incorrect but I remain suspicious. Something must have become broken in the recent clustering refactoring.\r\n\r\nFrom the method CDbwEvaluator.invalidCluster comment (used to enable pruning):\r\n   * Return if the cluster is valid. Valid clusters must have more than 2 representative points,\r\n   * and at least one of them must be different than the cluster center. This is because the\r\n   * representative points extraction will duplicate the cluster center if it is empty.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, inspection of the test log indicates that only k-means and fuzzy-k are not pruning clusters. Clearly some more investigation is needed. I will take a look at it tomorrow. In the mean time if you develop any additional insight please do share it with us.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJeff\r\n\r\nOn 5/17/12 3:53 PM, Pat Ferrel wrote:\r\n> I built a tool that iterates through a list of values for k on the same data and spits out the CDbw and ClusterEvaluator results each time.\r\n>\r\n> When the evaluator or CDbw prunes a cluster, how do I interpret that?
