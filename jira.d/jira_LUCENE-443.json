Such skipping is needed for conjunctions.\r\nSince the score value of a document for a query depends on the score value of the subqueries,\r\nat some point the association on a single document must be done.\r\nFor conjunctions, skipTo() is used, but for disjunctions this association is done by\r\na priority queue in the trunk, and a distribution like method in 1.4.3. This distribution method works\r\nsomewhat loosely on document order, and is therefore incompatible with skipping.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPaul Elschot\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl","name":"paul.elschot@xs4all.nl","emailAddress":"paul dot j dot elschot at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180"},"displayName":"Paul Elschot","active":true},"created":"2005-10-11T16:44:08.000+0000","updated":"2005-10-11T16:44:08.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317502/comment/12361284","id":"12361284","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"It seems like more cruft could be removed if support for incremental adding of subscorers was removed.\r\nIs there a reason we can't simplify things and just pass Collection<Scorer> in the constructor?\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2005-12-28T04:48:25.000+0000","updated":"2005-12-28T04:48:25.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317502/comment/12436414","id":"12436414","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"body":"Yonik, Paul, do either of you know the status on this one?
