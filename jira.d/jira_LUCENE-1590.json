I know, it does not affect functionality (as only the stored contents can be retrieved). In principle the Field instances should have *no* indexing options. Luke would the display nothing anymore, but for this case it would really be better to make the Field infos \"public\", so somebody could enumerate all fields and test then, which options were used during indexing. Mixing this with retrieval of stored fields is not good.\r\n\r\nOne case is now not implemented correctly in FieldsReader: A binary stored field have a special if-clause in FieldsReader. The binary field is loaded as stored only, currently only omitTf and omitNorms are set (I added this). But e.g. INDEX is always false and so on. In principle for completeness, all options from FieldInfo should be replicated here.\r\nFieldsReader would be better to have a central method like copyFieldOptions(FieldInfo, Fieldable), that copies all options from FieldInfo to the Fieldable (without looking at the stored contents). The other if-cases should only initialize the stored parts and type. I think, I give it a try.\r\nThe whole info is now more important: If somebody in the past had stored the string contents compressed, he must now use a binary field and compress himself. In this case, Luke would not display any indexing options anymore.
