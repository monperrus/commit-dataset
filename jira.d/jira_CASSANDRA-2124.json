You're talking about a couple of very trivial, pre-compiled regexes (one for {{USE}} to track the current keyspace, and one for {{SELECT}} to get the columnfamily).  For what it's worth, drivers written in other languages are faced with solving the same problem, and utilizing the node-side parser is not an option for them.\r\n\r\nbq. 3. Is there a way to get ColumnFamily Name from CqlResult/CqlRow itself?.\r\n\r\nThis strikes as me as wasteful since the results will always correlate to a single column family, (and we shouldn't need the node to tell us).\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=urandom","name":"urandom","emailAddress":"eevans at opennms dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031"},"displayName":"Eric Evans","active":true},"created":"2011-02-15T17:55:45.473+0000","updated":"2011-02-15T17:55:45.473+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497871/comment/12995983","id":"12995983","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mishravivek","name":"mishravivek","emailAddress":"vivek dot mishra at yahoo dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Mishra","active":true},"body":"Draft patch with logic for column decoding as discussed.\r\n\r\nThis is not final patch as i need to correct code style check and test case around it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mishravivek","name":"mishravivek","emailAddress":"vivek dot mishra at yahoo dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Mishra","active":true},"created":"2011-02-17T19:04:09.684+0000","updated":"2011-02-17T19:04:09.684+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497871/comment/12997544","id":"12997544","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=urandom","name":"urandom","emailAddress":"eevans at opennms dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=urandom&avatarId=10031"},"displayName":"Eric Evans","active":true},"body":"I didn't spend a great deal of time looking at this since you've indicated that it's a work in-progress, but one thing worth mentioning is that I think the decoder should exist as a part of the vanilla driver, where it can be used by the JDBC one (much the way {{o.a.c.cql.driver.Connection}} is).\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure what your comfort level is with reading Python, but I committed a result decoder to the Python driver recently.

Should we replace rowmetadata with ResultsetMetaData?\r\nThe problem with using ResultSetMetaData is that it is a bad interface for Cassandra's sparse columns.  A good example is that column 0 in one row might map to a column named \"foo\", while column 0 in another row might map to a column named \"bar\".  The Wrappable interface exists so that JDBC driver implementations can provide features beyond the JDBC API without the ugliness of casting.  I think it is better to make the programmer fully aware that he is dealing with sparse columns and forcing him to use the RowMetaData API.\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear your points on the benefits of using ResultSetMetaData though.
