Embretsen","active":true},"body":"Ant looks for the \"ant.properties\" file in the directory specified by Java's \"user.home\" system property. Since this does not necessarily corespond with %HOME% or $HOME, BUILDING.txt should be corrected.\r\n\r\nOn Windows 2000 and XP, the \"user.home\" directory in most cases corresponds to the environment variable %USERPROFILE%, which is a concatenation of the variables %HOMEDRIVE% and %HOMEPATH%, e.g. \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\User\".\r\nSee http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds_shelloverview.mspx.\r\n\r\nOn Unix/Linux systems, the \"user.home\" directory in most cases correspond to the $HOME environment variable (e.g. \"/home/username\"), but this is not always true, as described above.\r\n\r\nhttp://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4787931 is a bug report that describes some issues and workarounds related to the way a variety of  JVMs determines \"user.home\". On Windows, Java actually tries to determine the user home directory by looking in the registry for the location of the user's desktop folder, and uses that folder's parent folder as \"user.home\". On Unix/Linux systems, Java determines the user's home directory by looking at the user's entry in the password file, e.g. /etc/passwd.\r\n\r\nI suggest changing BUILDING.txt, section 3.2 (1) to something like this:\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n(1) Determine the directory on your system that corresponds to\r\n    the \"user.home\" system property of the jvm referred to by\r\n    JAVA_HOME. This directory will be referred to as the \r\n    ${user.home} directory in the rest of this document. \r\n    In order to correctly determine the value of ${user.home}, \r\n    do either of the following:\r\n\r\n\ta) Run ant diagnostics and look for \"user.home\" in the\r\n           list of System properties:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t   ant -diagnostics\r\n\r\n\tb) Write and run a small java program that prints the\r\n           value of the \"user.home\" system property, e.g. by\r\n           including the following line in the program:\r\n\r\n           System.out.println(System.getProperty(\"user.home\"));\r\n           \r\n    On most Unix systems, ${user.home} is equivalent to the\r\n    value of the environment variable $HOME or $home.\r\n    On newer Windows systems, ${user.home} is often equivalent\r\n    to the environment variable %USERPROFILE%.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any comments to this suggestion?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnemb","name":"johnemb","emailAddress":"johnemb at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John H.
