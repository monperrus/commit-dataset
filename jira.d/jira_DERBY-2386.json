IF the expected difference is in seconds then SQL_TSI_SECOND should be used. This is a solution to the error that is being reported in the description. So, I think this is not a bug.\r\n\r\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-dev/200511.mbox/%3Cc25576af0511281539te6c1eefw48a9dcc993ad709c@mail.gmail.com%3E\r\n\r\nThe discussion above on the derby-dev list on the same topic and that talks about returning BIGINT instead of INT. I am inclined towards NOT doing that because there is no gap between the values covered by TSI_FRAC_SECOND and TSI_SECOND.

If seconds returned the fractional portion, then it would be sufficient to always use seconds, and multiply within application code as needed. But the nature of data-driven programs is that we don't know whether the interval will be less than a second, less than a minute, or even less than a day.\r\n\r\nBy limiting the function return value to integer, the usefulness of this function is severly limited. Many applications require fractional-second accuracy to time certain events, events which could possibly take > 1 second.\r\n\r\nCalculating an interval in Java uses milliseconds, i.e. date1.getTimeInMillis() - date2.getTimeInMillis(). It seems like a Java-based dbms should be able to mimic this Java concept.\r\n\r\nI urge you to expand the return type to BIGINT (Java long).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhsmith","name":"dhsmith","emailAddress":"don dot smith at novell dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Don Smith","active":true},"created":"2007-03-06T15:23:40.237+0000","updated":"2007-03-06T15:23:40.237+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363902/comment/12479339","id":"12479339","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mayureshnirhali","name":"mayureshnirhali","emailAddress":"Mayuresh dot Nirhali at Sun dot COM","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mayuresh Nirhali","active":true},"body":"I concur.
