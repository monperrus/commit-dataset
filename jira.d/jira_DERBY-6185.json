ValueNode.getClone() overwrite is a good suggestion too but the user will need to be aware of that method rather than instantiating a new node. So, advantage of ValueNode.getClone() is less code will be touched and advantage of init methods is the new param won't be overlooked. I will be fine with either approach if one way seems better than the other but in the mean time, I will start working on writing new regression tests.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.
