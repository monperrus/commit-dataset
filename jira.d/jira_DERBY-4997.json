I am thinking that we should just have the test check for the things it is looking for and not fail for additional lines as it often does as new things are added or if jvm's have multiline version output.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that  while the output checks for this test focus on network server, this is the only test that we actually have for Sysinfo,\r\nSo it might be nice to expand it  at some point to check the other things that sysinfo outputs.  As another aside I am seeing permission errors in the sysinfo output for java.home, user.name and user.home. I thought this was addressed at one point, but will file an issue if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2011-02-03T23:50:04.118+0000","updated":"2011-02-03T23:50:04.118+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497490/comment/12990630","id":"12990630","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Here is the patch I would like to commit for this issue.
