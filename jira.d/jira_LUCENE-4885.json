That's why I first, too, thought it should be on FacetResult, and that we can just use numValidDescendants. I'm torn here too, not sure what to do about TopKInEachNode. I guess that we could resolve this by separating FRN and TreeFRN, while FRN recording ordinal, value and label and TreeFRN recording subResults and uniqueChildrenCount? The problem is how to iterate on the results...\r\n\r\nHmm, maybe the cut needs to be higher up at FacetResult level, with FacetResult (flat) and HierarchicalFacetResult. FacetResult will give you an Iterator<FRN> and if it's Hierarchical or TreeFacetResult), you get in practice an Iterator<TreeFRN> ... also, FR will record uniqueChildrenCount. For TreeFR this can mean the total unique count, or just at the root level...\r\n\r\nToday, for the common case, we spend a List pointer at each FRN, which is null. Perhaps, as you say, it's usually a non issue since you ask for a low K ...\r\n\r\nOne other solution would be to hide the uniqueChildrenCount and subResults behind methods, so that FRN returns -1 and null, while TreeFRN implements them accordingly?\r\n\r\nIn general, I feel that FacetResult and FRN are too verbose. I think that the root node's statistics could be available from the FacetResult level, and that it could give you an iterator directly, rather than giving you a node which you always *must* call root.subResults... but it's for a separate issue.\r\n\r\nRegarding TopKInEachNode, I wonder if we should eliminate that completely from FacetRequest, and create an appropriate FacetResultHander which you configure with the levels that you want, including (potentially, in the future) different K values for different levels?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2013-04-07T14:40:52.446+0000","updated":"2013-04-07T14:40:52.446+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639167/comment/13625008","id":"13625008","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"bq.

I added a test to TestFacetsCollector and fixed the code. So actually this issue turned from a new feature to a bug :).\r\n\r\nMike, thanks for doing the work to add it to FRN, it made the fix very easy - I just pulled it to FacetResult instead. All the tests that you added helped validate the fix.\r\n\r\nI think it's ready.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"created":"2013-04-10T19:01:29.406+0000","updated":"2013-04-10T19:01:29.406+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639167/comment/13628128","id":"13628128","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"+1, thanks Shai!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2013-04-10T19:05:19.508+0000","updated":"2013-04-10T19:05:19.508+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639167/comment/13628138","id":"13628138","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"Committed to trunk and 4x.
