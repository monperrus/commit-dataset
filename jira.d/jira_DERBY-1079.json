This is particularly important for the published API which we expose to end-users.\n\nRight now you can do the following:\n\n1) Build the whole codeline using the 1.4 compiler for most classes and the 1.6 compiler for the JDBC4 support.\n\n2) Build javadoc in a 1.4 environment (with JAVA_HOME set to 1.4). This runs step (1) if it has not already happened. This javadoc excludes the JDBC4 support because generics-laden JDBC4 signatures choke the 1.4 compiler.\n\n3) Build the javadoc in a 1.6 environment (with JAVA_HOME set to 1.6). This will fail if you have not run step (1); this is because you can't build Derby in a 1.6 environment yet. This also generates a number of warnings because the 1.6 javadoc tool objects to code generated by the JAVACC grammar tool; JAVACC turns out code with loop variables distastefully named \"enum\". In addition, today, the 1.6 javadoc excludes the JDBC4 support.\n\nWe would like to end up with the following situation:\n\na) If your ant.properties points at a 1.6 installation, then the javadoc targets will use the 1.6 javadoc tool and will include Derby's JDBC4 support. This will work regardless of whether you have already built the class tree. If you have not already built the class tree, then we will compile it under scenario (1) above.\n\nb) If, however, your ant.properties does not point at a 1.6 installation, then the javadocs target will continue to use the 1.4 javadoc tool to build only the classes built today. The JDBC4 support will be excluded from this javadoc.\n\nc) As part of releasing 10.2, we will build the javadoc under scenario (a).\n\nd) Once 1.6 exits beta and becomes a production vm, the community can debate when we want to fix DERBY-1078 and require 1.6 in the build environment.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"40643","summary":"Build javadoc  under jdk 1.6","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310090":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":"","customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12310050":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":19,"total":19,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12329862/comment/12369286","id":"12369286","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"body":"Just curious, but would any of the new JDBC 4 classes actually show up in the published api?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"created":"2006-03-08T03:07:56.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-08T03:07:56.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12329862/comment/12370758","id":"12370758","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Some new DataSource implementations (which satisify the JDBC4 DataSource contract) would turn up in the published api.
