Your approach looks fine, and it seems to work correctly in most cases. The one thing that didn't seem to work, was when a script ended with a comment. Apparently, ij then thinks we have started a new statement and emits a syntax error on EOF. I have attached a repro as comment2.sql.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the indentation in readBracketedComment() is a bit funny. Each line starts with a single tab character which is followed by a number of space characters. I think it would be better not to mix different indentation characters on the same line.\r\n\r\nStatementFinder defines constants for some \"special state-changing characters\". Would the code be more consistent if readBracketedComment() used those? At least, it defines a slash constant, but it seems like we need to add a constant for asterisk ourselves.\r\n\r\nI was also wondering if readBracketedComment() would be simpler if we used peekChar()/readChar() instead of maintaining the flags lookingForSlash and lookingForAsterisk. Something like:\r\n\r\nchar peek = peekChar();\r\nif (nextChar == ASTERISK && peek == SLASH) {\r\n    readChar();\r\n    ...\r\n} else if (nextChar == SLASH && peek == ASTERISK) {\r\n    readChar();\r\n    ....\r\n} else {\r\n    ....\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2007-12-12T08:07:15.993+0000","updated":"2007-12-12T08:07:15.993+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12383725/comment/12551669","id":"12551669","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=james.f.adams","name":"james.f.adams","emailAddress":"derby at xemaps dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"James F.
