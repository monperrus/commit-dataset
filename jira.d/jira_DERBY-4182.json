When compress table runs it finds the deleted rows and reclaims them along with the 1st overflow page that that point to, so 2 pages per failed unique constraint insert in the sample program.  The problem is that the abort results in all of the other links of the overflow pages being broken and thus compress table can't find them.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to use some existing functionality in the store to process the broken link pages during the abort insert as purges rather than deletes which will move them to free pages.

This fix changes insert abort processing to automatically put\r\nall pieces of long columns except for the head page on the free list as part\r\nof the abort.\r\n\r\nNote this does not fix existing tables that have had this problem happen in\r\nthe past, only stops it from happening.  One must run an offline compress to\r\nreclaim this space to fix any instances of this bug prior to this fix.\r\n\r\nsvn 778926 fixes this bug in the trunk.  Once this change has passed nightly\r\ntests in the community across a number of platforms I plan to backport it at\r\nleast to 10.3.\r\n\r\nm4_ibm16:147>svn commit\r\n\r\nSending        java\\engine\\org\\apache\\derby\\impl\\store\\raw\\data\\BasePage.java\r\nSending        java\\testing\\org\\apache\\derbyTesting\\functionTests\\tests\\store\\Cl\r\nobReclamationTest.java\r\nTransmitting file data ..\r\nCommitted revision 778926.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2009-05-26T23:31:13.146+0000","updated":"2009-05-26T23:31:13.146+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12423524/comment/12714318","id":"12714318","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"check in svn 779849, backports the fix from the trunk to the 10.5 branch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2009-05-29T06:14:33.812+0000","updated":"2009-05-29T06:14:33.812+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12423524/comment/12714319","id":"12714319","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"the fix is actually to abort processing, not really a problem with compress.
