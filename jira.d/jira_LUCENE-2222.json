It is based on some code I found on the Web (a problem is that I don't find anymore its origin. If I remember, it was from an academic project in c) that I translated, fixed and optimised. I can share it if you're interested.

I remember looking for a link to an implementation of Simple16 in one of the articles on Simple9, but the linked page had gone, so I just went ahead myself and started on Simple9.\r\nOne can also use 32 or 64 cases (5 or 6 bits for the cases) and use a variable number of ints (or bytes) in the encoded forms of such SimpleNN variants. Such variants nicely hit the middle ground between Simple9 and PFOR in block length and decoding speed. Perhaps we'd better continue the discussion on such methods at LUCENE-2189.\r\n\r\nWhen there are sufficient methods available an issue could be opened for a general variable length block encoding/decoding that uses the best of such methods depending on the block length. This makes sense because in lucene indexes the block length is always known.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl","name":"paul.elschot@xs4all.nl","emailAddress":"paul dot j dot elschot at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180"},"displayName":"Paul Elschot","active":true},"created":"2010-01-18T18:39:07.610+0000","updated":"2010-01-18T18:49:16.848+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-2222/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04s4f:"}}
