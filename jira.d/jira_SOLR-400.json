It returns an HTML error page on malformed URL requests, thus, even though http://333.333.333.333:8080 is not a valid address, OpenDNS forwards the request to a help screen that gives alternate information\n\nNot really sure there is a fix for this, except to make it localhost with some port that is more than likely not going to be used to server anything, but I am noting it here in case anyone else runs across this issue.
