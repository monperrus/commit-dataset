It's not elegant but makes it possible to address this issue without changing the DRDA protocol.  The idea is supporting database path aliases as a property.  This may have other benefits / uses as well.  Your thoughts please.\r\n\r\n   Idea:\r\nI know that some databases [maybe even DB2? DB2 uses DRDA and does not encounter this problem] store location (host / port / path / name [or alias]) information in a file.  Could we implement something similar (database names/aliases) using derby properties that can be read by Network server from the derby.properties file to resolve database names on the connection URL?  For the server-side you would only,  I think, need to specify the absolute or relative path to the database.  \r\n\r\nThis seems innocuous enough a feature that we could backport to the older codelines to resolve this issue?  It would only impact existing implementations that chose to set the property.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that something like what is done for the USER property might work well: \r\n\tderby.dbalias.myDbAlias=<Yada-Path>/realDbName\r\nAnd the connection URL would list only 'myDbAlias'??

I once started looking at this issue and I i got some way towards a solution. My impression from looking at the DRDA spec is that it may not be THEORETICALLY possible (because of limitations such as those mentioned by Kathey), but in PRACTICE there should be possible to extend Derby's driver to use a different encoding and fall back to the old behavior when connected to an old server.

When working on it, I didn't really aim for a minimal solution, so it may be possible to achieve this with less work than what my patch suggests.\r\n\r\nBased on what I can remember it seems like you are on the right track. Once the negotiating is working you just need to go through the code to find all the places where it is assumed that a given string length will fit in the same number of bytes. That isn't too bad as I recall, but there are some sticky points where a string, encoded in the negotiated charset, should be placed in DRDA fields which are specified with a fixed BYTE size, and should be padded to the correct size with space chars. This is simple as long as you can rely on the space character fitting in one byte, but when supporting encodings such as UCS-2 where space is two bytes, you can no longer use Arrays.fill() directly...\r\n\r\nI also think there is a DRDA field where you are supposed to fill in the client's ip-address (or part of it) as a string in the negotiated charset, and that the number of bytes you can use is not enough to encode in UCS-2. But I think I concluded that this field is not used for anything important, so deviating from the spec here should not be a problem...

The  short summary is this:\r\n\r\nEXCSAT and ACCSEC are always sent EBCDIC.  As part of the MGRLVL exchange,  client sends UNICODEMGR 1208 which means that it is requesting all additional DDM parameters will be exchanged in code page 1208.  The server responds with UNICODEMGR 1208 if it can accommodate the request.  Otherwise it responds with UNICODEMGR 0 and all DDM parameters will continue to be exchanged in EBCDIC.\r\n\r\nOne problem with this approach is that ACCSEC currently has an RDBNAM parameter which we treat as required (the spec lists it as optional) and that has to be sent EBCDIC.  So, my proposal is that we use the UNICODEMGR and we send  RDBNAM on ACCSEC *only if*  the EBCDIC conversion can be done.   If the conversion can't be done, we send no RDBNAM on ACCSEC.  Then we change the server to use the RDBNAM sent with the unicode  SECCHK instead of the one sent on ACCSEC.   (Currently we just verify that the SECCHK RDBNAM is the same as the one that was sent on ACCSEC.)\r\n \r\nFor an old client working with a new server, there will be no regression and the error message on sending a database name with international characters will be the same as currently listed in \r\nDERBY-728.\r\n\r\nFor a new client working with a old server, this will mean that  all the cases that currently pass will still pass, but if a nonconvertible database name is sent (e,g, one with Chinese \r\ncharacters) , the server will send back a SYNTAXRM and the \r\nserver console will show:\r\n  = 2110; Error Code Value = e. Plaintext connection attempt \r\nfrom an SSL enabled client?\r\norg.apache.derby.impl.drda.DRDAProtocolException: Execution \r\nfailed because of a Distributed Protocol Error:  DRDA_Proto_\r\nSYNTAXRM; CODPNT arg  = 2110; Error Code Value = e. Plaintext \r\nconnection attempt from an SSL enabled client?\r\n        at \r\norg.apache.derby.impl.drda.DRDAConnThread.throwSyntaxrm(DRDAConn\r\nThread.java:513)\r\n        at \r\norg.apache.derby.impl.drda.DRDAConnThread.missingCodePoint(DRDAC\r\nonnThread.java:543)\r\n        at \r\norg.apache.derby.impl.drda.DRDAConnThread.parseACCSEC(DRDAConnTh\r\nread.java:1948)\r\n        at \r\norg.apache.derby.impl.drda.DRDAConnThread.processCommands(DRDACo\r\nnnThread.java:943)\r\n        at \r\norg.apache.derby.impl.drda.DRDAConnThread.run(DRDAConnThread.jav\r\na:290)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe client could intercept the SYNTAXRM and  knowing it was unable to convert the RDBNAM to EBCDIC could throw the same message it does now.  The only regression  would be that users attempting to send an invalid database name would now see the server side protocol error occur. I think it  is an acceptable regression, since it won't cause any working  cases to fail even with mixed revision server/client and it will enable us to move forward and have internationalized  database name, user and password.  \r\n\r\nI prototyped the change and it all seemed to work ok.  I'll attach the prototype patch.\r\n\r\nI  would like to implement as much as possible of this for 10.5, but since approval of the ACR by opengroup won't happen by the time we release 10.5, I propose to make the implementation dependent on a client system property derby.drda.unicodemgr=true.  This would be false by default but could be switch to true in a maintenance release once opengroup approval occurs. Currently the hope is to have the ACR available publicly by the end of January.  Then I would need Rick's help to try to push it through opengroup since he is our opengroup rep.

It got me thinking about SQL identifiers. It seems from the changes to chapters 6 and 7 on page 5 that DRDA still thinks that sql identifiers are limited to 255 bytes. I don't know where this limitation actually surfaces. It doesn't surface in the simple test I have attached (BigTableName) which pokes and peeks a table whose schema name and table name are each 128 unicode characters long, represented in utf-8 as 384 bytes apiece.\r\n\r\nBut it may prevent us from extending our DRDA or SQL support in the future. The maximum length of a SQL identifier is 128 unicode characters, according to part 2 of the 2008 SQL Standard, section 5.2 (<token> and <separator>), syntax rule (13). Derby supports this maximum length. At two bytes per Java character, this works out to 256 bytes, not 255. Since each unicode character can potentially expand to 4 bytes in UTF-8 encoding, the maximum length of a UTF-8 encoded identifier is 512 bytes. I believe that DRDA's sql identifiers should be at least 256 bytes long and probably 512 bytes.\r\n\r\nThanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2009-04-17T18:52:15.062+0000","updated":"2009-04-17T18:52:15.062+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12326016/comment/12700286","id":"12700286","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Thank you Rick for looking at this.\r\n\r\nI too am concerned about the  DRDA 255 byte character string limit.

Espinha","active":true},"body":"I'm attaching two patches to this issue.\r\n\r\nThe first, DERBY_728_p2_sanity.diff aims at fixing an issue with sanity. I was making calls to the SanityManager without a check to verify that the DEBUG was enabled. A question that remains open is: what do we do with the exception on a sane build? Is it ok to muffle it and only deal with it on insane mode?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second patch, DERBY_728_p3.diff, should in principle enable UTF-8 support in the server. I'm not sure I've missed something but I'll post a short explanation of what I've done:\r\n\r\n- CodePoint.java\r\nInserted the new code point for UNICODEMGR (0x1C08) as per the ACR and added it to the MGR_CODEPOINTS array.\r\n--\r\n\r\n- NetworkServerControlImpl.java\r\nSet the minimum manager level for the UNICODEMGR in synch with the MGR_CODEPOINTS array.\r\n--\r\n\r\n- AppRequester.java\r\nSet the minimum manager level for the UNICODEMGR in synch with the MGR_CODEPOINTS array.\r\n\r\nAlso added a convenience method that tells us whether the AppRequester depicted by this class supports or not UTF8. This relies on the manager level for UNICODEMGR being greater or equal to 1208. If the requester does not support UTF8, we won't get a UNICODEMGR manager level on the EXCSAT and as such UNICODEMGR will be set to 0 (which means this convenience method will return false).\r\n--\r\n\r\n- DRDAConnThread.java\r\nWhen dealing with the ACCSEC code point and after we send the ACCSECRD reply we check whether the appRequester supports UTF8 and if it does, we enable it through the switchToUtf8() method [also part of the patch]. If it doesn't, make sure it goes back to EBCDIC, to make sure we aren't in UTF8 from the previous connection.\r\n--\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how I'd go about testing this as a client would have to support UTF-8 as well to be able to test it and this is still just the server side implementation. It will be a good test though to see if all regressions pass tonight; tomorrow, provided that this patch seems to be ok, I will do testing with older clients and see what the outcome is.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=espinha","name":"espinha","emailAddress":"tiago dot derby at espinhas dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tiago R.

I think it is fine to just ignore for insane builds, because we don't think it can happen and if it did the NPE that would result would be pretty easy to track.\r\n\r\nIt's great to see us so close on the server side!\r\n\r\n\r\nKathey","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2010-06-29T20:43:37.574+0000","updated":"2010-06-29T20:43:37.574+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12326016/comment/12930150","id":"12930150","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=espinha","name":"espinha","emailAddress":"tiago dot derby at espinhas dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tiago R.
