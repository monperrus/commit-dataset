But I think it would be wise to emphasize that the example schema is just that - an *example* - encouraging people to create new fieldTypes instead of editing the example ones. It's not a problem for \"int\", \"date\" etc, but for text I always encourage our customers and students to stay away from the FieldTypes in the example and make their own versions instead.\r\n\r\nOne way to further encourage this best practice is naming all text FieldTypes clearly as examples, e.g. \r\n\r\n{code}\r\n<fieldType name=\"text_example_en\" ..>\r\n<fieldType name=\"text_example_generic\" ..>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe must realize that a lot of non-american users out there are already customizing their schemas with the naming pattern \"text_<lang>\", which means you'll find \"text_en\", \"text_it\", \"text_no\" in a lot of installations. Therefore it would be un-wise to introduce new FieldTypes wich crashes with those names out of the box in version 3.2, thus include _example in the type name.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading, I always leave all the example field types intact, and add my custom ones separately, clearly marked by comments for easy copy/paste. I believe this to be a fairly common practice, and wanted as well, which would give no clashes for the above example.\r\n\r\nWith this example naming practice, we can be pretty sure that if people talk about the fieldType \"text_example_en\" on the lists, they mean the default example type, but if they talk about \"text_en\", it's something they've customized themselves (if so by simply renaming the example). It'll be more mental resitance for people to start modifying something with \"_example\" in it wihout also changing the name.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=janhoy","name":"janhoy","emailAddress":"jh at cominvent dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=janhoy&avatarId=10130"},"displayName":"Jan Høydahl","active":true},"created":"2011-05-18T22:21:31.491+0000","updated":"2011-05-18T22:21:31.491+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507279/comment/13036104","id":"13036104","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"+1 to naming these fields text_example_XXX.
