Instead of doing this we can generate a proxy once per client BundleContext per service and cache it between lookups. The cache needs to be managed, so if the client goes away we clear the cache and if the service goes away we purge it too.\r\n\r\nI have written the code and shown that it improves performance so I'm raising this JIRA so I can integrate the performance fix.\r\n\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"168176","summary":"osgi:service JNDI damping performs like a one legged dog under an anesthetic","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=not","name":"not","emailAddress":"not at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384"},"displayName":"Alasdair Nottingham","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=not","name":"not","emailAddress":"not at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384"},"displayName":"Alasdair Nottingham","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":0,"total":0,"comments":[]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ARIES-338/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0t5cn:"}}
