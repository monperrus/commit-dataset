To sstable the value is just byte[] so the fact that CF serializes with indexes is an implementation detail.

I think that's going to get us to a stable 0.3 fastest; if we want to radically re-think how indexing works (so we can go back to index-at-the-end-of-one-file) then I think that is a change to make in 0.4.  (The non-sparse index Cassandra uses may be necessary if you want to support large CF rows, or you will waste too much time scanning through those rows looking for keys when you only get to within 128 keys from the index.)\r\n\r\nOne thing that piqued my curiosity: what is the hbase \"row index?\"  Looks like their \"key index\" is like our sstable indexes (with the difference mentioned above, that it only indexes one key per block).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-06-02T02:06:49.843+0000","updated":"2009-06-02T02:06:49.843+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426691/comment/12715554","id":"12715554","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=junrao","name":"junrao","emailAddress":"junrao at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jun Rao","active":true},"body":"When HBase was using the old format, rows are stored as <key,value> pairs in MapFile, where a key is rowkey:columnName:timestamp.
