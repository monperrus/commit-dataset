Therefore, I think that it is better to fix all of them at once. Fixing only a couple of them makes the current state of the code harder to understand. For instance, I don't understand why setBlob(null) should fail on a CHAR parameter, but succeed on a DOUBLE parameter.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure whether this type checking should happen on the server. Since the DRDA protocol doesn't preserve which JDBC method was used, and which arguments the user passed in, it might not always have enough information to decide what to do. Another problem with having the check on the server, is that old clients (or jcc clients) running against a new server will also get these new exceptions. Some people might call that a regression.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible to get the type checks on the client instead of on the server, I would prefer that solution. If that is not possible, I think we should only make sure that all setXXX(null) calls work as before DERBY-1535, and delay the change of behaviour until we have found a way to make all calls behave correctly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot

Does that match embedded? I though embedded used 22005.\r\n2) Would it be possible to have the integer arrays as constants?

saying they must be sorted in case someone needs\r\nto modify them later. Also, I think it would be clearer (and safer) if\r\nthey were defined as\r\n\r\n  CONSTANT = Arrays.sort(new int[] { .... });\r\n\r\nThat would explicitly show that they are sorted. Since the sorting\r\nonly happens when the class is loaded, it shouldn't be a performance\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nAnother small comment is that POSSIBLE_TYPES_IN_SET_XXX is identical\r\nfor boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double and BigDecimal. It\r\nwould probably be good to use one constant only (for instance,\r\nPOSSIBLE_TYPES_IN_SET_SCALAR). It would reduce the disk and memory\r\nfootprint. The same comment is valid for the\r\nPOSSIBLE_TYPES_FOR_XXX_NULL constants.\r\n\r\n(In fact, for the types mentioned above, the\r\nPOSSIBLE_TYPES_FOR_XXX_NULL constants could also be used by the setXXX\r\nmethods. The only difference between FOR_XXX_NULL and IN_SET_XXX, is\r\nthat the setNull constants contain BIT, TINYINT, NUMERIC and FLOAT\r\nwhereas the setXXX ones don't. Since these types also are compatible\r\nwith int, byte, boolean etc., it wouldn't hurt to add them to the\r\nsetXXX constants.)\r\n\r\nI don't know what is meant by \"XCL12 is temp\" in parameterMapping, but\r\nI assume it's because the one who wrote it meant only one SQL state\r\nshould be used for all conversion errors.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-09-12T18:38:41.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-12T18:38:41.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12346905/comment/12435283","id":"12435283","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=naka","name":"naka","emailAddress":"tomonaka at basil dot ocn dot ne dot jp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tomohito Nakayama","active":true},"body":"I upload new patch DERBY-1610_5.diff.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, int[] object of possible types are accessed via PossibleType class.\r\nThe object of this class sort array of possible types when constructed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore objects which have same possible types are unified and \r\nexceptions for incompatible type are unified to that of 22005.\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=naka","name":"naka","emailAddress":"tomonaka at basil dot ocn dot ne dot jp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tomohito Nakayama","active":true},"created":"2006-09-17T04:59:39.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-17T04:59:39.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12346905/comment/12435413","id":"12435413","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=naka","name":"naka","emailAddress":"tomonaka at basil dot ocn dot ne dot jp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tomohito Nakayama","active":true},"body":"Through examing the patch.\r\nI found a problem that Engine throw exception of XCL12 when String typed value is passed to BLOB typed variable though the patch throw exception of 22005 .\r\n\r\nExceptions found in my environment using TestTypeCompatiblity.java are as next.\r\n\r\nnaka@rufelza:~/derby/wok/20060918$ javac TestTypeCompatibility.java\r\nnaka@rufelza:~/derby/wok/20060918$ java TestTypeCompatibility embedded\r\nstreamAsNull:\r\nERROR XCL12: An attempt was made to put a data value of type 'java.lang.String' into a data value of type 'BLOB'.\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.iapi.error.StandardException.newException(StandardException.java:316)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.iapi.types.DataType.throwLangSetMismatch(DataType.java:601)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.iapi.types.DataType.setValue(DataType.java:343)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.EmbedPreparedStatement.setString(EmbedPreparedStatement.java:492)\r\n\tat TestTypeCompatibility.update(TestTypeCompatibility.java:71)\r\n\tat TestTypeCompatibility.main(TestTypeCompatibility.java:45)\r\njava.sql.SQLException: Invalid cursor state -

So, I suggest we use verbage that suggests more differences may exist.\r\n\r\nI propose something like the following for the release note, please review & correct:\r\n------------------------------\r\nSummary of Change\r\nDerby's Client implementation will return an appropriate error, matching the behavior with Embedded in the a number of situations related to PreparedStatement.setNull(int, int). \r\n\r\nSymptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change\r\nIn a number of situations, Derby's client implementation behaved differently from the Embedded implementation:\r\n1. setNull(LONGVARCHAR) on parameter of type CHAR FOR BIT DATA (Types.BINARY).\r\n\tIn previous releases, the Client succeeds, embedded fails (state 22005).\r\n2. setNull(LONGVARBINARY) on parameter of type CHAR FOR BIT DATA (Types.BINARY).\r\n\tIn previous releases, Embedded succeeds, client fails (state 22005).\r\n3. setNull(LONGVARBINARY) on parameter of type VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA (Types.VARBINARY).\r\n\tIn previous releases, Embedded succeeds, client fails (state 22005).\r\n4. setNull(BINARY) on parameter of type LONG VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA (Types.LONGVARBINARY)\r\n\tIn previous releases, Embedded succeeds, client fails (state 22005).\r\n5. setNull(TIME) on parameter of TIMESTAMP. \r\n\tIn previous releases, Client succeeds, embedded fails (state 22005).\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibilities with Previous Release\r\nNow, in the cases indicated above, the client and Embedded implementation show the behavior previously shown only with Embedded.\r\n\r\nRationale for Change\r\nDerby's Client implementation and Embedded implementation should behave the same way from the point of view of an application whenever possible.\r\n\r\nApplication Changes Required\r\nApplications relying on the Client behaving in the old way will have to be adjusted.\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf I do not hear objections, I'll proceed with this plan.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail
