Do not consider collection provided in request or default-collection\r\n* In BasicDistributedZkTest.testCollectionsAPI, we already create at least 3 new \"awholynewcollection_X\" collections. Used to be created using HttpSolrServer. Now create the first using a CloudSolrServer without default-collection, and create the second using a CloudSolrServer with a non-existing default-collection. The rest of the collections are still created using HttpSolrServer\r\n** Refactored a little to be able to use the existing code in AbstractFullDistribZkTestBase for CloudSolrServer instance creation. Dont copy code - reuse!\r\n\r\nBasicDistributedZkTest is still green, but didnt run entire test-suite. Couldnt imagine that the fix destroied any existing test. Committer should of course run entire test-suite before commit (asuming you are running test-suite pre-commit).
