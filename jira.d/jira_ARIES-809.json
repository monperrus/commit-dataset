It should be possible to configure the transaction manager using the PID \"org.apache.aries.transaction\" but but this doesn't work. Even if this PID is bound to the transaction manager it doesn't pick up the new configuration but uses the default values anyway.\r\n\r\nI have tested configuration of the transaction timeout (which doesn't work) but I suspect that the transaction manager doesn't pick up any configuration. I know that ServiceMix sets the \"logFileDir\" property to \"${karaf.data}/txlog/\" which I suspect doesn't work either.\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed on the Aries user list at:\r\n\r\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/aries-user/201112.mbox/%3CCAJ0TPGLo=u=bf+Ep0hG2DJjZATFOKV8KbMN5hfLkSwfw8-JNLg@mail.gmail.com%3E\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"62719","summary":"Not possible to configure transaction timeout","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rodehav","name":"rodehav","emailAddress":"bengt at rodehav dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bengt Rodehav","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rodehav","name":"rodehav","emailAddress":"bengt at rodehav dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bengt Rodehav","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Windows XP, Karaf 2.2.5","customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":1,"total":1,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538493/comment/13251482","id":"13251482","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gnt","name":"gnt","emailAddress":"gnodet at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Guillaume Nodet","active":true},"body":"File fixing the ArrayOutOfBoundsException and remove the use of ManagedServiceFactory in favor of a simple ManagedService","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gnt","name":"gnt","emailAddress":"gnodet at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Guillaume Nodet","active":true},"created":"2012-04-11T11:40:41.772+0000","updated":"2012-04-11T11:40:41.772+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ARIES-809/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0b3qv:"}}
