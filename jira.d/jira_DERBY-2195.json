The patch fixes the stated problem of this jira.  After looking at the trigger code in more detail, it appears that \r\nthe system is not cleaning up the statement context properly.  The cleanup should have been performed in GenericTriggerExecutor's executeSPS exception handler  (see patch for further comments).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, there is another potential problem with the exception handling logic in executeSPS() where it assumes that the SPS has executed and therefore will have a new statement context and pops it off from the LCC.  This is somewhat dangerous as StandardException can occur before pushing the new statement context to the stack; hence, this might result in popping the wrong statement context.  So the patch also addresses this issue.\r\n\r\nderbyall and junit suite passes.  Appreciate if someone can review this.

Indeed, I have the same question too when I was fixing this jira.  \r\n\r\nAt first glance, it appears that it makes sense to call statement context clean up code when an exception has occurred in the class that creates the new statement context.  However, this does not work well when Server side JDBC comes into play.  The cleanup mechanism for invoking a Java procedure has a different cleanup code path that uses the global context stack and will clean up the various contexts in the order that they were pushed down till the \"last context handler\".  I think the \"last context handler\" concept is for handling in the case where the system does not want to rollback the entire execution context but to a certain statement context.  (e.g.:  CALL statement may be executing various SQL statements and each of those statement has its own statement context.  If one SQL statement fails with exception and the Java procedure decides to handle the exception, it must not rollback the entire execution context but only up to the statement context object that fails, and then the Java procedure continues on.)   \r\n\r\nSo if a statement context cleanupOnError() is called within the place where it pushes it, the sc will be cleaned and removed from the global stack and the exception is rethrown to the next exception handler which will eventually invoke ContextManager's cleanupOnError method and cleans up on the current global context stack.  So a statement context here is cleaned up too soon and if for some reason, the outermost statement (CALL statement) needs to access its statement context (i.e.:  sc.clearSavePoint()), it will throw an internal exception since the outermost statement context has been popped off.  (see GenericStatementContext's pleaseBeOnStack()).\r\n\r\nHence, I think that that is why the SPS (GenericPreparedStatement) does not clean up the statement context on error but rely on other classes or mechanisms such as GenericTriggerExecutor or ContextManager's cleanupOnError() for proper cleanup.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"created":"2007-01-02T22:15:32.575+0000","updated":"2007-01-02T22:15:32.575+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12358946/comment/12461867","id":"12461867","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Hi Yip, thank you for the explanation, and for being patient with my questions :)\r\n\r\nI don't have any further questions of my own.
