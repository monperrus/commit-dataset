As it started failing after I moved the tests on those branches to new machines (with a different OS, and on vmware), and there were no relevant changes in derby code, it seemed indicated that there was something different about those machine.\r\nAlso noteworthy was that the tests didn't fail for 10.8 and 10.5 branches, and only failed for weme, not any other jvms. \r\n\r\nThe problem is really that this test did not try to find out the correct executable. The master shows the test expects to spawn a process using the executable name 'java'. The executable for weme is 'j9'. The machines where this passed with weme, had an additional jvm installed in the windows system directory, so it was actually spawning that. Presumably this was true on the old machines for the other branches too.\r\nWith 10.10 and trunk this has been corrected by converting the test to a junit test, where it figures out the correct executable.\r\n\r\nI have the following options for fixing this:\r\n1) add a jvm to the system path on the machines where this was failing\r\n2) disable the test for weme in all derbyall runs on all branches\r\n3) correct the test, i.e. making it look for the j9 executable if that's the jvm we're running with, and either add an additional j9 canon to the master directory and/or add more ignoring code for the _sed.properties file\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point however, I'm not interested in adding complexity of a proper check for the older branches and either add, and I prefer to just disable this test with weme there.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2013-06-10T18:25:24.441+0000","updated":"2013-06-10T18:25:24.441+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12651189/comment/13679770","id":"13679770","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"body":"Commit 1491566 from [~myrna]\r\n[ https://svn.apache.org/r1491566 ]\r\n\r\nDERBY-6251;
