The rationale was that this point could be picked up by PointPrefixTreeFieldCacheProvider for distance/sorting.  However this approach is buggy since the distinction of grid cells between the center point and the shape itself is lost when the shape gets indexed down to max-levels precision -- each grid cell therein appears to be another point that needs to be brought into memory.  It's also possible that the shape is a LineString or some other non-trivial shape in which its center point isn't actually in the shape.\r\n\r\nEven if you knew this problem would never happen, I think you're better off indexing center points into another spatial field if you want them.  Perhaps arguably this strategy could do that internally?
