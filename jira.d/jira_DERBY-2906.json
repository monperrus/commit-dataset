Feedback up front is welcome.\r\nOption c is too fragile and might cause problems if users build separate jars.\r\nOption a is a two line fix (+comments).\r\nI don't know enough to say if option b is sound, but it would probably be the safest one against future changes/additions.\r\n\r\nI also discovered some jar build targets use an antcall, whereas others do the same \"manually\".
