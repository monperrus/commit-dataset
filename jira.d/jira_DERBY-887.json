This patch disables the illegal implicit and explicit casting between BOOLEANs and non-string data types. I am running regression tests now.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in previous comments, one tricky piece of this bug is the fact that the Derby metadata queries rely on illegal casts which involve BOOLEANs. The solution proposed here is:\r\n\r\n1) Raise coercion errors when trying to bind an expression which needs to cast between BOOLEANs and non-string types.\r\n\r\n2) Change all of the metadata queries which have illegal BOOLEAN casts. Replace the casts with calls to the INTEGER function. That function can already convert a BOOLEAN to an INT, although our user guides can't say that because technically BOOLEAN is not supported.\r\n\r\n3) Adds new test cases to verify the correct casting behavior. One class of tests cannot be written today: the explicit casting of other data types to BOOLEAN. Those tests cannot be written until BOOLEAN is re-enabled.\r\n\r\nTouches the following files:\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/BooleanTypeCompiler.java\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/CLOBTypeCompiler.java\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/BaseTypeCompiler.java\r\nM

java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/DataTypeDescriptor.java\r\n\r\nRaise errors if an attempt is made to coerce between BOOLEAN and a non-string data type.\r\n\r\n\r\nM      java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/ODBCMetadataGenerator.java\r\n\r\nChange metadata queries to use the INTEGER function rather than illegal casts.\r\n\r\n\r\nM      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/CastingTest.java\r\n\r\nAdd new test cases to verify that the bug is fixed and to verify that we have disabled implicit and explict casting between BOOLEANs and non-string data types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/subquery.sql\r\nM
