However, there is definitely still something wrong. With the latest trunk, I don't see the extra mystery columns in the IJ output. However, I do appear to be getting wrong results.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree with Yip that in the wrong results case, the query is ambiguous and should be rejected with an error. Interestingly, in the wrong results case, Derby currently chooses neither of the answers that Yip suggested, but instead chooses to display all three rows! Thus Derby currently chooses to violate the DISTINCT part of the query, rather than violating the ORDER BY part of the query. Given that the two parts of the query are in conflict, I'm not sure that it really matters very much which part of the query Derby disobeys, as either way is wrong and the only thing that can be done is to reject the query as ambiguous.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching reproTests.diff, a patch proposal with some new test cases for the ORDER BY test suite. These test cases demonstrate the wrong results.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't currently have a fix for this problem, or even a clear idea of how to fix it, I thought that it would be useful to post the test cases anyway. \r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2007-06-10T21:45:30.577+0000","updated":"2007-06-10T21:45:30.577+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363059/comment/12505035","id":"12505035","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"DERBY-2805 also describes problems when DISTINCT and ORDER BY are combined in a single query.

From the user's perspective there is only a single column in the query's result list, so the error seems slightly misleading.

Any idea how hard it would be to catch that scenario and throw 42879 instead of 42X89?  Would this just be a matter of checking to see if the column was \"pulled\" into the select list and, if so, throwing 42879 instead of 42X79?  Or is it more complicated than that?

Same problem with the current patch. It was made from the head of trunk, right?\r\n\r\nI agree that the second query from 10.2 produces the wrong results - it's using an explicit table.columnname reference for ordering. In this particular case an ambigous error would be better that wrong results.\r\n\r\nCould we use the fact that the user specified tableName.columnName, and not just columnName to distinguish between the aliased and original column names somehow?

I also see potential for breaking existing applications with such changes. But if keeping the old behavior produces wrong results, your current patch with throwing an ambiguous exception is still a lot better than returning wrong results IMHO!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thomanie","name":"thomanie","emailAddress":"thomas dot nielsen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Nielsen","active":true},"created":"2008-03-04T08:32:51.231+0000","updated":"2008-03-04T08:32:51.231+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363059/comment/12575061","id":"12575061","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=army","name":"army","emailAddress":"qozinx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"A B","active":true},"body":"> I think this behavior predates this patch, and moreover it is also\r\n> independent of whether DISTINCT is present. \r\n\r\nAh, okay, thanks for pointing that out.\r\n\r\n> if we had really sorted the rows by person.age we'd have produced the result\r\n> \r\n> AGE\r\n> ----------\r\n> john\r\n> mary\r\n> john\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, note the following:\r\n\r\nij> select * from person order by age;\r\nNAME      |AGE\r\n----------------------\r\njohn      |10\r\njohn      |30\r\nmary      |50\r\n\r\nIf we sort the rows by person.age the order is, in fact, \"john, john, mary\".
