The rule was already described in the class, but the implementation didn't obey them:\r\n o use synchronized (this) when accessing in-memory dependencies (deps stored in BasicDependencyManager)\r\n o don't use synchronized (this) when accessing stored dependencies, but rely on database locking (deps stored in the data dictionary / a system table)\r\n\r\nI haven't come across cases where we need to synchronize over both sets of dependencies (at the same time).\r\n\r\nMain changes in BasicDependecyManager:\r\n o split body of addDepencendy into addInMemoryDependency and addStoredDependency\r\n o corrected JavaDoc for coreInvalidateFor (the flag 'forSync' doesn't exist)\r\n o fixed synchronization in clearDependencies (this is where the automatic index stats update feature got stuck in a deadlock)\r\n o reformatted (+tiny refactoring) clearInMemoryDependencies\r\n o deleted commented out methods getAllProviders and getAllProvidersInfos\r\n o removed synchronized for getPersistentProvidersInfos and rewrote method\r\n o removed synchronized for copyDependencies\r\n o fixed synchronization in countDependencies\r\n o deleted unused method dumpDependencies (and then bubbleSort)\r\n o rewrote methods getProviders and getDependents for new sync rules\r\n o replaced HashTable with Map\r\n o removed methods newSList\r\n\r\nChanges in ViewsTest and BaseJDBCTestCase:\r\n o added method assertStatementErrorUnordered, as the ordering of in-memory and stored dependencies changed to to the changes described above (this can easily be switched back, but I don't see why - decided to make the test more resilient to varying ordering instead).\r\n o used the new assert method were the test failed\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-running regression tests.\r\nPatch ready for review.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2010-12-06T16:33:10.178+0000","updated":"2010-12-06T16:33:10.178+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12491877/comment/12968701","id":"12968701","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Regression tests passed.\r\nI haven't seen the hang with the automatic index statistics update feature using this patch either,although I haven't run the tests that many times yet.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2010-12-07T12:30:31.999+0000","updated":"2010-12-07T12:30:31.999+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12491877/comment/12969269","id":"12969269","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Looks like a good cleanup to me. +1\r\n(One small typo in a comment in BaseJDBCTestCase: \"Run throgh\" -> \"Run through\")","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-12-08T10:45:20.225+0000","updated":"2010-12-08T10:45:20.225+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12491877/comment/12969284","id":"12969284","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the review, Knut.\r\nI fixed the comment before committing patch 1a to trunk with revision 1043367.\r\n\r\nI don't plan to backport this fix, at least not now.
