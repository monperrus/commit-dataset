Lucene natively no longer has support for lazy field loading, but there is a \"backwards layer\" just for Solr in modules/misc (LazyDocument.java)\r\n\r\nYeah .. LazyDocument is seriously evil...\r\n\r\nbq. The document does not use maps to lookup, if you have many fields its always a scan through the ArrayList of all fields in the document.\r\n\r\nIt's worse then that though -- having many fields and scanning through them all to fetch a single field value (or an array of field values for a single name) is a cost that has to be paid in 4.x regardless of whether you are using LazyDocument or not, the root problem here seems to be having fields that contain many _values_.  That problem is exacerbated by the fact that unlike 3.x lazy loading, 4.x LaxyDocument/LazyField doesn't do anything to \"cache\" the fields you've already asked for.\r\n\r\nBelow are my notes from investigating this and trying to get up to speed on the new world order of document loading w/o FieldSelector.  I'll experiment with some fixes after i get some food...\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCENE-2308 - r1162347\r\n* IndexReader.doc(int,FieldSelector) deleted\r\n* FieldSelector moved to misc\r\n* new concept StoredFieldVisitor introduced\r\n** void IndexReader.document(int docID, StoredFieldVisitor visitor)\r\n* new impl DocumentStoredFieldVisitor extends StoredFieldVisitor\r\n* new impl FieldSelectorVisitor extends StoredFieldVisitor \r\n** appears all the old FieldSelector logic from IndexReader moved here?\r\n** contains a private \"LazyField extends Field\" that caches field values once fetched\r\n* SolrIndexSearcher modified to use FieldSelectorVisitor\r\n\r\nLUCENE-2621 - r1199779\r\n* eliminates FieldSelector & FieldSelectorVisitor\r\n* leaves StoredFieldVisitor & DocumentStoredFieldVisitor intact\r\n* introduced public LazyDocument containing \"LazyField implements IndexableField\"\r\n** this version of LazyField does _not_ cache any data once fetched\r\n* changes SolrIndexSearcher's SetNonLazyFieldSelector to extend StoredFieldVisitor\r\n** add's LazyField to the Document for any fields not immediately needed\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crux of the problem is that:\r\n* LazyDocument is lazy about loading the doc, but once you ask for the value any LazyField, the entire Document (with all underlying IndexableField values) is loaded.\r\n* even though the entire document has been loaded once a single LazyField is used, the performance of iterating over LazyField's is *TERRIBLE* when there are lots of values for a single field\r\n* requests for the value of individual LazyFields are not cached/stored anywhere, so the poor performace affects all subsequent re-uses of the same LazyDocuments\r\n\r\nDetails...\r\n\r\nThe state tracked in a LazyField is a refrence back to the underlying LazyDocument, the field name, and the \"num\" offset of this IndexableField in the list of values for that field name.  When you ask the LazyField for it's value, it asks the underlying LazyDocument to fetch the entire Document (if it hasn't already) and then it asks that Document for _all_ values of the assocaited field name as an arry, and then it looks up it's \"num\" offset in that array.\r\n\r\nSo if you build up an (outer) Document containing N LazyField instances for field named \"foo\" (as is done in Solr's SetNonLazyFieldSelector), and then try to iterate over the values with something like {{String[] values = outerDoc.getValues(\"foo\");}} under the covers LazyField will load every value of every field of that document into memory as an \"innerDoc\", that innerDoc will be asked N times to generate a new IndexableField[] of every value of field \"foo\" (which BTW: involves iterating over every IndexableField value of every field) and N-1 elements of that array will then be ignored and thrown away.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me why FieldSelectorVisitor was eliminated in LUCENE-2621 (no discussion in the comments on point) but it's also not clear to me why LazyDocument+LazyField would ever be a good idea in any application that had more then a handful of fields (and if you don't have very many fields, why are you lazy loading?).  \r\n\r\nIt's also not clear to me why the LazyDocument version of LazyField doesn't include the same caching logic as the version that was included in FieldSelectorVisitor (or the older lazy loading code in 3.6) because w/o that the usage pattern in Solr -- in which Document objects are cached -- results in the worst of all possible worlds: once a Document is cached with only a small subset of \"real\" fields, and the rest are \"LazyField\" instances, every subsequent request for that document that involves those LazyFields is slow, even if they ask for the same LazyField over and over.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2013-03-15T21:02:28.685+0000","updated":"2013-03-15T21:02:28.685+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637241/comment/13604124","id":"13604124","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"Digression...\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\nIt really feals like the whole LazyDocument API and usage pattern -- particularly the semantics in which \"LazyDocument.getField(FieldInfo)\" can be used -- is really brittle and confusiong.\r\n\r\nIt assumes it will be called exactly once for each StorableField that exists for that field name, in order because the internal counter is assumed to correspond exactly wit the array index of the corresponding array of values.

They could wind up calling the method twice on the same field and getting lazy fields pointing at two differnet values (the first and second StorableField instances for that field name)\r\n\r\nnone of which directly relates to this particular bug, but since this public class seems to have been added solely for solr, it may be worth considering deprecating it, and moving the logic solr needs into protected/private classes.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n...as for the matter at hand...\r\n\r\nI reworked the internals of hte class a bit so that:\r\n\r\n* LazyField instances cache their underlying values similar to how lazy loading worked in 3.x\r\n* Asking for the value of a LazyField instance causes all LazyField's (produced by the same LazyDocument) with the same field name to be \"actualized\" in a single pass over the underlying document\r\n\r\nThe changes eliminate the pathalogical case of iterating over many LazyFields, and shouldn't add much even in the edge case of only carrying about a single field value when there are many -- it's still a single loop in the underlying Document of the fields, there's just no more short circut for hte single value case.\r\n\r\nIn order for these changes to work, the LazDocument has to now keep a reference to every LazyField it generates so that they can all be repopulated when one of their filed name brothers is repopulated.  The memory footprint of this shouldn't be too bad in the common case (afterall: the LazyDocument was already fetching the entire underlying Document keeping the whole thing around as long as there was a single LazyField in the heap) but just to be safe i made it track the list of LazyFields using weak refrences -- so even if someone asks for a bunch of LazyField instance for a field named \"foo\", and then throws away all but a few of them, they can be garbage collected regardless of how many other \"foo\" LazyFields are still arround or when/if their real values are loaded.\r\n\r\nPatch includes a few test updates in solr to sanity check that lazy loading value caching works, but i definitely want to add some true LazyDocument unit tests to the module (there don't seem to be any at all at the moment) to exercise the \"all lazy fields with the same name get populated at the same time\" and \"what if a weakref LazyField goes away\" logic before i'd consider committing.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFeedback would be greatly appreciated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2013-03-16T05:25:44.438+0000","updated":"2013-03-16T05:25:44.438+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637241/comment/13605968","id":"13605968","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"updated patch\r\n\r\nin addition to adding more tests, i added logic so that when the underlying document is fetched to populate the lazy fields, only the specific fields needed will be loaded (so if a doc contains fields w, x, y, and z, and the client code fetches field w and requests that fields y and z be lazy loaded, then field x will never be read. and field w will not be fetched redundantly.\r\n\r\nwould really appreciate feedback, i'd like to get this into th 4.2.1 bug fix release","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2013-03-19T02:34:05.953+0000","updated":"2013-03-19T02:34:05.953+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637241/comment/13606388","id":"13606388","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"Still trying to wrap my head around how all this works... particularly with synchronization and why the old implementation, or the patch, are thread safe.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure we should be using weak references though.
