I agree that it's not a major problem as one might as well implement the interface {{CandidateItemsStrategy}} directly. The abstract class *{{AbstractCandidateItemsStrategy}}*, however, provides a convenient basis for strategies that also implement the {{MostSimilarItemsCandidateItemsStrategy}} interface. The code can be easily copied, but given that most other abstract classes in taste can be extended, I believe that the restricted visibility might be unintentional.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=david.geiger","name":"david.geiger","emailAddress":"geiger dot net at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Geiger","active":true},"created":"2013-08-09T17:11:27.877+0000","updated":"2013-08-09T17:11:27.877+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12662821/comment/13735150","id":"13735150","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tdunning","name":"tdunning","emailAddress":"ted dot dunning at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Dunning","active":true},"body":"David,\r\n\r\nYou are exactly right.
