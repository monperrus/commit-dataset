and pwd (as before) and port number (and hostname, as there's no constructor with just the other 3 params) if basePort property is set\r\n- sets the derby.drda.portNumber property in the JDBCDriversEmbeddedTest, because it uses derby.drda.startNetworkServer, which otherwise defaults to 1527.\r\n  I think it's OK to make this change as it's not the purpose of this test to test the portnumber - that's tested in derbynet.DerbyNetAutoStartTest.\r\n- removes the skipping from DERBY-6178 if non-default port is specified.\r\n\r\ntests ran cleanly with this change, both suites.All as
