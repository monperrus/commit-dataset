From my perspective this is much cleaner, as you can pass in a missingValue directly when populating the FieldCache. FieldComaparator would simply call FieldCache.DEFAULT.getInts(reader, parser, defaultValue). The cache would use the triplet including defaultValue as key. The sorting code would not need to be changed at all (this is similar to Doron's idea, but moved to FieldCache and not FC.setNextReader).\r\n\r\nWe should think about this in an additional issue and for now only fix the broken implementation in 3.x.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2011-09-21T11:08:28.255+0000","updated":"2011-09-21T11:08:28.255+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12519669/comment/13109423","id":"13109423","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Here a patch with a more clean API (as noted by Mike McCandless):\r\n- backported the Bits interface from Lucene trunk (do a svn cp http://svn.apache.org/..../trunk/..../Bits.java before applying the patch\r\n- Added interface to the well-known impls in util package\r\n- FieldCache.getUnValuesDocs returns Bits now which makes the API very clean\r\n\r\nThis breaks backwards a bit more, as Bits does not extend DocIdSet, so code using the new FieldCache method will break, before recompilation was enough (as FixedBitSet extends DocIdSet).\r\n\r\nMike: How about this?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2011-09-21T12:06:48.557+0000","updated":"2011-09-21T12:06:48.557+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12519669/comment/13109434","id":"13109434","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Looks great Uwe!
