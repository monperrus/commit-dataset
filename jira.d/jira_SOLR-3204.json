This is not a \"simple\" Maven metadata issue. Even if you consider solr-commons-csv to be an internal part of Solr it's now a public Maven artifact that people are starting to use in their projects (The Apache Commons teams even starts receiving bug reports for solr-commons-csv). When Commons CSV is officially released there will be a conflict if solr-commons-csv and commons-csv are both brought to the classpath through the transitive dependencies of a project, because they have the same classes in the same package.\r\n\r\nImagine a project using Solr and doing CSV stuff with Commons CSV, when the CSVParser classes is instantiated it can be either the one from solr-commons-csv or the one from Commons CSV, this is guaranteed to break badly.\r\n\r\nThe right approach is to change the package of solr-commons-csv, for example to org.apache.solr.commons.csv, so both solr-commons-csv and Commons CSV can coexist on the classpath without conflict. This can be automated with the Maven Shade plugin.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ebourg","name":"ebourg","emailAddress":"ebourg at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ebourg&avatarId=10141","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ebourg&avatarId=10141","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ebourg&avatarId=10141","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ebourg&avatarId=10141"},"displayName":"Emmanuel Bourg","active":true},"created":"2012-03-06T08:09:38.702+0000","updated":"2012-03-06T08:09:38.702+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545266/comment/13223193","id":"13223193","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"This is a maven issue. solr-commons-csv only exists to maven.\r\n\r\nOtherwise these are just classes inside the war file (essentially an implementation detail of solr).\r\nIt seems to me, no offense, that the solution is to make an official release of commons-csv!\r\n\r\nThen nothing needs to coexist, as we would rather use a release instead anywaay, and all \r\ngrandfather poms,wagons, nexuses,surefires,whatever in maven will be adjusted and everyone is happy.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2012-03-06T12:35:39.512+0000","updated":"2012-03-06T12:35:39.512+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545266/comment/13223198","id":"13223198","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ebourg","name":"ebourg","emailAddress":"ebourg at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ebourg&avatarId=10141","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ebourg&avatarId=10141","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ebourg&avatarId=10141","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ebourg&avatarId=10141"},"displayName":"Emmanuel Bourg","active":true},"body":"I agree a release of Commons CSV is desirable, but that's not a reason for using the namespace of other projects.

Yes, he has a conflict. The situation is not different here.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nOnce Commons CSV is released we guarantee the binary compatibility of the next releases. The Apache Commons team takes compatibility issues very seriously because our components are reused in many projects. When we have to break the compatibility the code is moved to a new package to avoid conflicts. For example Commons Lang 3 broke the binary compatibility with the previous releases and used a new namespace org.apache.commons.lang3 to avoid issues.\r\n\r\nIf Solr wants to shield its user from incompatibilities, even after Commons CSV is officially released, it's possible to automate the process of renaming the package of the dependencies. That's what Tomcat does with Commons DBCP.

able to then satisfy all dependencies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Solr is a end-user product, so I have no idea why it is in maven at all. You download the distribution and install it. If you need to compile plugins against it, setup your eclipse classpath. Lucene is different, but it has no patched JARs (it does not depend on any external JAR at all). The Xerces JAR in benchmark is also only a \"utility\" package, that should not be in maven.\r\n\r\nTo come back to the example:\r\n- Jetty should not be a problem, because Solr will upgrade to Jetty 8 (breaking lots of backwards). For the Jetty 6 series there is no support at all, so there will not be a new release. Our fixed Jetty 6 is just a plain jetty with one broken unicode method patched. If somebody accidently have it in his classpath, he will be happy that Chinese, Japanese, and Mormon UTF8 works correct...\r\n- For the other JARs that have no other relations except to Solr, JARJARing them is no issue at all. It would be what I would recommend. This affects commons JARs like commons-csv, also noggit,\r\n- The ICU example is just a minor \"example\", we will not need to patch ICU, because they are releasing quite often.\r\n- If you have reflection dependecies or dependencies from other JARs in you classpath, you can still install the original unpatched version and you are happy.

It's also used by IDEs to import dependencies automatically and to be able to browse their source and Javadoc easily. It's difficult to understand why this part is also hated by Maven detractors. The constraints on the central repository aren't that unbearable, the most important rule to follow is to not publish two artifacts identified by distinct groupId:artifactId with conflicting classes.

That said, I\r\ndon't think Maven has any right to \"peek in\" and force Solr's private\r\ndependencies to become public; what deps Solr uses is an\r\nimplementation detail of Solr. Short of removing Solr from Maven, is\r\nthere some way to publish Solr's WAR through Maven while keeping (some\r\nof?) its dependencies private?\r\n\r\nIssue 2: JAR hell (runtime CLASSPATH pollution): this is an age old,\r\nwidespread issue, completely orthogonal to Maven.  Regardless of how a\r\nproject builds its artifacts, if it has external dependencies, it will\r\nof course \"pollute\" the CLASSPATH.  This is a well known problem.\r\n\r\nReally, we should open a new issue for issue 2: it has nothing to do\r\nwith Maven and is long-standing (our ant-produced artifacts have had\r\nthe issue forever).  In practice, this has never seemed to be a\r\nproblem to users, presumably because users don't usually embed Solr.\r\nNormally users deploy the WAR and use as-is, except for plugins.  If\r\nwe really think this needs to be fixed (I'm doubtful), there are\r\nvarious options... eg OSGI seems to \"solve\" this, but adds complexity.\r\nJarjar, minijar, ant replace, are also options, but I don't like the\r\nrisk of hard-to-explain bugs.

The patch/branch is ready, just needs committing. We can then ship with unmodified Jetty 8, as the Unicode bugs should be fixed.\r\n\r\nFor the other projects I see no real problem in using jarjar (which is used in lots of projects): Lets simply investigate what foreign namespaces we use in our packages (e.g. we should also rename the Snowball classes, because we heavily forked them and they are still in org.tartarus namespace - as we forked that project, we should do it in the source code). For e.g. commons-csv we have no problem jarjaring our fork and re-release it. In the jarjar issue tracker is also a discussion about “hiding” renamed classes from GUIs by prefixing all renamed class names with $, so they are invisible for an autocomplete-using Eclipse developer, so nobody outside can use the jarjared classes outside Lucene/Solr.\r\n\r\nAbout the remaining issues Robert mentioned: They are all solvable. JarJar renames also class names inside strings used for reflection, it can also rewrite Manifests and META-INF (we use e.g. for codecs, or Apache Xerces uses to plug in the parser impl). I just would like to give it a try, it cannot happen more than our testcases do not run. The example Robert has given with external references to icu4j is exactly what we want to prevent with JarJaring, so it doesn’t apply in my opinion. If we patch and modify icu4j and ship with a package-renamed version, code that uses reflection outside the Solr/Lucene JAR is completely unaffected. If the external project side-by-side with Lucene/Solr wants to use icu4j it can simply include the original in any version, solr with its patched version is completely unaffected and vice versa.\r\n\r\nSo I would strongly suggest to jarjar all dependencies that we modified locally (means all foreign jar-files with solr-prefix). How we do this is a different issue: We can only rename all classes in that jar-file and republish it (but then we have to change our import statements in our code – I would prefer this), or we jarjar the whole Solr distribution after the complete build.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-03-07T14:46:12.836+0000","updated":"2012-03-07T14:46:12.836+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545266/comment/13224381","id":"13224381","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"How would this work for e.g. the carrot2 example?

Perhaps I could help?\r\n\r\nOption 1, which you've already detected, is to use jarjar or shade so that you can publish your fork of someone else's stuff in your own package namespace fairly painlessly, either storing it inside some other jar of yours or publishing it under your coordinates.\r\n\r\nOption 2 is optional dependencies: http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html.\r\n\r\nThis is a way to force the users of your artifacts to explicitly declare some or all of your dependencies, rather than getting them automatically. In other words, virality control.\r\n\r\nNow, if you don't publish one of these, anyone who uses your published artifact will get past the maven dependency graph -- and then sink or swim based on whether they've made their own arrangements to get the code into their classpath. I can't help wondering how this helps with the original complaint of the Common(s)-Folk: if you release a version of Lucene that requires a forked version of Commons, and you don't change the packages, you're setting up for a classpath conflict, sooner or later, with or without maven, aren't you?\r\n\r\n\r\nOption 3 is simply to observe that your users can always use 'exclude' to cut off following some dependency link of yours that doesn't appeal to them.\r\n\r\nDoes any of this help?\r\n\r\np.s.

For JAR hell, I thought even released versions can cause problems too?\r\n\r\nYes of course. But e.g. maven can help to prevent those problems. It will not allow you to add the same dependency in different versions. The issue we had caused by our separate release of unreleased package under the solr group-id was that maven is seeing our repackaged dependency under another artifact id - so it cannot prevent that a project adds solr-commons-xx, version-foo and commony-xx, version-bar, because it is two different things.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI see.  So then we \"subverted\" Maven's ability to catch the\r\nconflicting versions of the same dep, by not using the same\r\ncoordinates that commons-csv will eventually use, once they release?\r\n\r\nGiven that, as crazy as this sounds, maybe we should have published\r\nusing the same coordinates?  Ie this way Maven apps would know they\r\nhad conflicting versions (one, from Solr, of what is basically a\r\npre-release snapshot of commons-csv, and another of a real, eventual\r\nfuture commons-csv release).\r\n\r\nOr.... maybe Maven should not make it a hard requirement that a\r\nnon-snapshot release (of Solr) cannot depend on a snapshot release (of\r\ncommons-csv)?

The issue we had caused by our separate release of unreleased package under the solr group-id was that maven is seeing our repackaged dependency under another artifact id - so it cannot prevent that a project adds solr-commons-xx, version-foo and commony-xx, version-bar, because it is two different things.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nExactly.  If you publish a maven artifact under a custom groupId:artifactId the sane thing to do is make sure the classes don't overlap with the old one.  Maven guards against duplicate artifacts in the same classpath.  Otherwise users will implicitly get both copies on their classpath too easily.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nThe arguments that this is more than a maven issue are bogus.\r\nDo you take me for a fool?\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nWhat happens if a non-maven user gets both solr-commons-csv.jar and commons-csv.jar on their classpath?\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nI think you missed my point?: Changing the Ant build to fix a Maven problem is a non-starter.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThen specify it as <optional>true</optional> or <scope>provided</scope>.  If you publish to maven central a pom.xml that says \"Solr must have jar FOO!\" and then complain that it is a \"Maven problem\" when jar FOO is actually used, then you've used maven incorrectly.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nUsers would have to either have to a) download the binary release and manually install the non-Maven artifacts one-by-one in their local or internal repository (after consulting both the top-level Maven POM and a list of per-module dependencies that currently only exists in a lib/ directory listing); or b) download the source release, run ant get-maven-poms, then run mvn -N -Pbootstrap install. Neither of these fall within the expected level of effort for Maven users.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nor C)\r\nyou can publish the artifacts, link to them as optional, and users can specify in their pom's which jar to bring in.  This is not that uncommon -- it is the expected way to deal with slf4j for example, where one and only one of several options must be chosen at runtime.
