FWIW: The other issue to consider here is how the packaging of these \"uber-module-jars\" will work in Solr binary pacakges ... right now it's the solr contribs that provide the factories that ensure the lucene modules they depend on make it into the final tgx/zip files ... if lucene modules start providing the factories themselves, we'll need some build.xml shenanigans to copy those module jars into the solr package dirs.\r\n\r\n...but we punted on it there.\r\n\r\nbq.

I think we should continue to punt on the larger issue (of including arbitrary lucene jars like codecs and what not) in the binary release, and focus here in this issue on treating the

unneccessary hoops to build the javadocs *because* it didn't use lucene-libs and libs properly ... i think i've fixed it appropriately.\r\n\r\n2) since solr-test-framework is not truly a contrib, i didn't put it's resulting README.txt, lucene-libs and lib dirs under \"contrib\" in the binary package, but i also didn't really think it made sense to pollute the top level dir with another directory
