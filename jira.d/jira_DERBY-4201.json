Not when running SecureServerTest alone, but when running as part of a suite so that there is a network server from an earlier test case that's only partially shut down when SecureServerTest starts.\r\n\r\nSee the attached repro.diff that combines the changes in the DERBY-5194 repro patch with adding NetHarnessJavaTest at the beginning of the test suite returned by SecureServerTest.suite(). With that patch, SecureServerTest fails when running alone.\r\n\r\nThe suspected cause of this intermittent failure is that the server used in an earlier test case might not be fully shut down when a new test case starts. The server shutdown command doesn't return until the server has stopped responding to ping. That works most of the time, but since it stops responding to ping before it actually releases the server socket, there is a possibility that the new server is started too early and fails to start listening on the port.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2011-12-05T15:17:37.481+0000","updated":"2011-12-05T15:17:37.481+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424187/comment/13162828","id":"13162828","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attaching a patch (d4201-1a.diff) which attempts to address these intermittent failures by making NetworkServerTestSetup wait until the previous test has completely shut down its server instance, before it tries to start a new server.\r\n\r\nThis is done by attempting to start a ServerSocket listening on the server port and immediately closing it.
