I think the main improvement we need is to not do blocking flushes while the locks are held.  For the purposes of creating a new memtable a nonblocking flush is fine.  For creating indexes we'll need to set up a callback to do the index building after the flush completes.  (We used to have code that took a callback arg as part of the flush call, I think I took it out but it should be relatively easy to resurrect.)  I agree that it touches a lot of code, but the core changes (i.e. not one-line things like encapsulating gcgraceseconds that are messy but not dangerous) aren't much larger than v1.  The huge improvement over waiting to re-sample indexes after UpdateCF is worth it imo.\r\n\r\nI'm also fine with saying that changing the CFS will blow away any JMX-applied changes and reset values to what the new CFM says the should be.
