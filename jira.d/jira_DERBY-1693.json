At the same time, this call is also used for getting the values of data types to do other operations. If getString() is changed to return a representation of the data that is only suitable for tracing, Derby will stop working. NetBeans counted 207 usages of the method.\r\n\r\nI tried changing getString(), and when executing a simple insert with a prepared statement, Derby went down miserably with a stack overflow error.\r\nI also tried adding the suggested getTraceString(), and things seemd to work (no LOB contents in derby.log and the test succeded).\r\n\r\nI think we can get away with a general implementation of getTraceString() that forwards to getString() in DataType and then write specific implementations for the types that require this (Clob and Blob).\r\n\r\n\r\nHave I overlooked something, or will this approach cause trouble?\r\nIf I don't get pushback, I will create a patch for the suggested approach.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2006-10-17T18:40:28.000+0000","updated":"2006-10-17T18:40:28.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12347943/comment/12444272","id":"12444272","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"'ReproDerby1693.java' is a repro for the bug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2006-10-24T09:53:00.000+0000","updated":"2006-10-24T09:53:00.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12347943/comment/12444308","id":"12444308","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"'derby-1693-1a.diff' adds the method 'getTraceString' to the 'DataValueDescriptor'-interface, and it is intended to be used for debugging/tracing.\r\n\r\nThings to consider:\r\n  a) The name of the new method (one could go for toString() instead)\r\n  b) The information being printed to derby.log\r\n\r\nCurrently, the value returned by 'getString' is logged for all data types except BLOB and CLOB.\r\nFor LOBs, one of the following is logged:\r\n * NULL\r\n * [BC]LOB(<size in bytes as returned by getLength()>)\r\n * [BC]LOB(<toString() of associated stream>)\r\n\r\nIf there is a stream associated with the LOB, it is not materialized when logging information to derby.log.\r\n\r\nI ran the All suite without errors. derbyall was also run without errors, but I changed something afterwards and is running derbyall again to be sure.
