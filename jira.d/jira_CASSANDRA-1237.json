Rather than determining the permissions that a user has, the IAuthenticator should only be capable of authenticating a user, and permissions (specifically, an AccessLevel) should be stored consistently by Cassandra.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Adding summary\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn summary, there appear to be 3 distinct options for how to move forward with authorization. Remember that this ticket is about disconnecting authorization (permissions) from authentication (user/group identification), and its goal is to leave authentication pluggable.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n# Leave authentication and authorization in the same interface. If we choose this option, this ticket is invalid, and CASSANDRA-1271 and CASSANDRA-1320 will add-to/improve IAuthenticator\r\n** Pros:\r\n*** Least change\r\n** Cons:\r\n*** Very little actually implemented by Cassandra: burden is on the backend implementors\r\n*** Each combination of authz and authc backends would require a new implementation (PAM for authc + permissions keyspace for authz, for instance), causing an explosion of implementations\r\n# Separate out a pluggable IAuthority interface to implement authorization\r\n## IAuthenticator interface would be called at login time to determine user/groups membership\r\n## IAuthority would be called at operation time with the user/groups determined earlier, and the required permission for the operation\r\n** Pros:\r\n*** Provides the cleanest separation of concerns\r\n*** Allows plugability for permissions\r\n** Cons:\r\n*** Pluggability of permissions gains limited benefit\r\n*** IAuthority would need to support callbacks for keyspace/cf creation and removal to keep existing keyspaces in sync with their permissions (although technically, option 1 suffers from this as well)\r\n# Separate authorization, but do not make it pluggable\r\n** This option is implemented by the existing patchset by attaching permissions to metadata, but could have an alternative implementation that stores permissions in a permissions keyspace.\r\n** Pros:\r\n*** Cassandra controls the scalability of authorization, and can ensure it does not become a bottleneck\r\n** Cons:\r\n*** Would need to support callbacks for user creation and removal to keep existing users in sync with their

I wanted to open a new ticket but when I looked over my code I thought that it's not ready and I want to work on it over the weekend.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch adds several classes:\r\n- +JAASAuthenticator:+ an IAuthenticator implemention that uses a LoginContext to request authentication against configured LoginModules. Very simple stuff.\r\n- +SimpleLoginModule:+ LoginModule impl that could replace SimpleAuthenticator.\r\n- +SimpleLoginModuleConfiguration:+ programmatic configuration of LoginModules.\r\n- +User/Group:+ implementations of java.security.Principal added by SimpleLoginModule to the Subject that is passed from the LoginContext to all configured LoginModules.\r\n\r\nThis is only proof-of-concept code. I hope I have something cleaner and more robust ready by Sunday.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=messi","name":"messi","emailAddress":"messias at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Folke Behrens","active":true},"created":"2010-07-29T18:23:42.366+0000","updated":"2010-07-29T18:23:42.366+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12468077/comment/12893766","id":"12893766","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"I agree that committing this was premature, and also apologize for not looking at it earlier.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-07-29T18:45:20.132+0000","updated":"2010-07-29T18:45:20.132+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12468077/comment/12893780","id":"12893780","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"body":"> If authorization should be pluggable (I've argued that is should be)\r\nI'd be interested in seeing the reasons for making permissions pluggable, if you know where I can find the thread.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"created":"2010-07-29T19:09:11.923+0000","updated":"2010-07-29T19:09:11.923+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12468077/comment/12893784","id":"12893784","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gdusbabek","name":"gdusbabek","emailAddress":"gdusbabek at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070"},"displayName":"Gary Dusbabek","active":true},"body":">> If authorization should be pluggable (I've argued that is should be)\r\n>I'd be interested in seeing the reasons for making permissions pluggable, if you know where I can find the thread.\r\n\r\nSeparation of concerns.
