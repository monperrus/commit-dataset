To specify these values yourself, construct an InputStreamReader on a FileInputStream. \"\r\nThus, to make blobclob4BLOB pass with -DderbyTesting.encoding=UTF-16 (you need the improved patch for test harness from DERBY-683 to run tests like that) I think this section needs to be changed to:\r\n            File file = new File(fileName[4]);\r\n            InputStream fileIS = new FileInputStream(file);\r\n            Reader fr = new InputStreamReader(fileIS, \"US-ASCII\");\r\n            ps.setInt(1, i);\r\n           ...\r\n            ps.setCharacterStream(6, fr, 300000);\r\n\r\nThis then passes with -DderbyTesting.encoding=UTF-16 with embedded (after also fixing DERBY-902) and DerbyNet. DerbyNetClient has some problem which I think may be due to DERBY-901\r\n\r\nI will run some more tests, then submit a patch for DERBY-903; if that proves ok & gets committed, this particular bug can be closed and unlinked from DERBY-658.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2006-02-13T19:37:06.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-13T19:37:06.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317041/comment/12367298","id":"12367298","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"This has now been fixed with DERBY-903, revision 379643\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2006-02-22T10:48:13.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-22T10:48:13.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317041/comment/12374478","id":"12374478","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"reopening issue to follow up on further work needed - the test still fails on zOS with ibm15 after fix for DERBY-658.\r\n\r\nI need to analyse it further.\r\n\r\nAlso, the test lobStreams.java fails (see DERBY-683), and it seems to me the failures may be similar.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2006-04-14T13:59:28.000+0000","updated":"2006-04-14T13:59:28.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317041/comment/12376155","id":"12376155","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"Attached is a patch for this issue - DERBY-575_102_20060424.*\r\n\r\nIt contains changes to and for the tests:\r\njdbcapi/blobclob4BLOB.java\r\njdbcapi/lobStreams.java\r\ntools/ieptests.sql\r\n\r\nThe changes boil down to ensuring that appropriate mechanisms are used to accessing supported files - and in the case of blobclob4BLOB and lobStreams, I ended up copying the supportfiles because they were used by other tests with another encoding.
