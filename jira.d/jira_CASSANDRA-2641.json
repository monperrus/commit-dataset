The patch has two problems:\r\n * It works only for Bounds, not Range. It will say that (1, 2] and (2, 3] are overlapping but it's not.\r\n * It does the check on the unsorted input list, so that's another reason why he will uncorrectly report overlapping\r\n\r\nBecause I'm stubborn, I'm attaching a patch that take the approach of making normalize() deoverlap overlapping ranges. It also add a number of unit tests for normalize.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slebresne","name":"slebresne","emailAddress":"sylvain at datastax dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630"},"displayName":"Sylvain Lebresne","active":true},"created":"2011-05-27T14:13:13.198+0000","updated":"2011-05-27T14:13:13.198+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12506934/comment/13048247","id":"13048247","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"body":"This seems like a reasonable approach, but now it overlaps quite a bit with StorageProxy.getRestrictedRanges: is there anything there that can be reused?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood at twitter dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu Hood","active":true},"created":"2011-06-12T05:30:15.633+0000","updated":"2011-06-12T05:30:15.633+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12506934/comment/13049042","id":"13049042","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slebresne","name":"slebresne","emailAddress":"sylvain at datastax dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=slebresne&avatarId=14630"},"displayName":"Sylvain Lebresne","active":true},"body":"bq. it overlaps quite a bit with StorageProxy.getRestrictedRanges: is there anything there that can be reused?\r\n\r\ngetRestrictedRanges splits a range at different tokens.
