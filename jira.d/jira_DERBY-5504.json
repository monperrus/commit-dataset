I don't think anyone has run the replication tests against remote hosts for a very long time, and given the instabilities we see when running the tests locally, I suspect there are even more problems. Maybe it's easier just to remove that code. There hasn't been much interest in improving the replication tests lately, and simplifying the tests by removing the code that supports remote testing might in fact make it easier to maintain the parts of the replication tests that we actually use in the daily testing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2011-11-17T09:25:18.675+0000","updated":"2011-11-17T09:25:18.675+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12531611/comment/13151995","id":"13151995","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attaching a patch for the replication tests (d5504-2a.diff).\r\n\r\nI took the path of least resistance and only changed the exec() calls that are used when running local tests.
