I logged DERBY-5919 for this.\r\n\r\nThe location of the sleep in EXCSQLIMM was not right, because the isValid call is actually a prepared statement call, see NetConnection40:\r\n         \"...\r\n                // Set the query timeout\r\n                isValidStmt.setQueryTimeout(timeout);\r\n\r\n                // Run the query against the database\r\n                ResultSet rs = isValidStmt.executeQuery();\r\n                rs.close();\r\n         ...  \"\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion with Kathey, I first tried the sleep in CodePoint.PRPSQLSTT, but that wasn't correct either, because before the above code snippet, NetConnection40 has this:\r\n      \r\n         \"....\r\n                if (isValidStmt == null) {\r\n                    isValidStmt =

server.\r\nThe right location for the sleep is in CodePoint.OPNQRY.\r\n\r\nI modified the current test with a test case that will not run unless one removes a 'x' in front of the fixture name, and added the sleep, but commented out, into DRDAConnThread.\r\n\r\nI also noticed the comment saying that isValid was also tested in TestConnectionMethods.java.\r\nThat test has been converted to junit and renamed ConnectionMethodsTest, so I updated the comment.\r\nI also modified ConnectionMethodsTest to have a longer timeout.\r\n\r\nI will attach these changes as patch, then commit these changes
