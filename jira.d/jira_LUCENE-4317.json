Robert: i certainly feel like if we want to take String we could just apply StringReader ourself by default (someone could override).\r\n\r\n+1. Just another idea: The Analyzer can internally also reuse a ReuseableStringReader like IndexWriter did in 3.x.\r\n\r\nPlease lets discuss all this in a separate issue and maybe for 5.0.
