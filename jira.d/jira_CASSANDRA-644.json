We could run a check periodically and remove all nodes from gossiper that have been silent for certain period of time, and do not have token associated with it. I'm not sure in what kind of situations this kind of clients are used, but if a node does not participate in storage and has been dead for an hour, there should be no harm in removing it. It will be back in gossip anyway immediately if it reappears. Cleaning up fat clients automatically would prevent gossip data from growing \"rapidly\" if there are many clients coming and going from different IP addresses.\r\n\r\nAs for \"proper\" storage nodes: These are likely to be more stable than clients, so probably it is best to have removetoken and/or other manual commands to take care of this.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jaakko","name":"jaakko","emailAddress":"rosvopaallikko at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jaakko Laine","active":true},"created":"2009-12-21T12:35:20.493+0000","updated":"2009-12-21T12:35:20.493+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443778/comment/12793240","id":"12793240","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"> We could run a check periodically and remove all nodes from gossiper that have been silent for certain period of time, and do not have token associated with it.\r\n\r\nthat sounds fine.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-12-21T15:59:06.563+0000","updated":"2009-12-21T15:59:06.563+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443778/comment/12799984","id":"12799984","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"(I originally marked this as Improvement, but isn't decommission/removeToken not cleaning out from gossip a Bug?)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-01-13T22:47:56.505+0000","updated":"2010-01-13T22:47:56.505+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443778/comment/12800232","id":"12800232","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jaakko","name":"jaakko","emailAddress":"rosvopaallikko at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jaakko Laine","active":true},"body":"yeah, that should probably be fixed.
