Adding the first 1000 documents to a small segment is probably more efficient than adding the last 1000 to a larger segment.  Doing more soft commits means creating smaller segments and doing more work in background merging using other CPU cores (basically, it increased the parallelism).\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2011-09-08T15:46:44.474+0000","updated":"2011-09-08T15:46:44.474+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12521822/comment/13100435","id":"13100435","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"I re-ran the 10M doc test with soft autocommit set to 10ms (obviously too low, but I just wanted to make sure that things didn't blow up).
