Seeley","active":true},"body":"1.9 is the earliest \"affects\" version we have in JIRA, but this underflow detection issue goes all the way back to the original floatToByte code added in v1.3\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the code only checked for underflow by checking the exponent:\r\n{code}\r\n    if (exponent < 0) {                           // underflow: use min value\r\n      exponent = 0;\r\n      mantissa = 1;\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nBut it's also underflow if the exponent is 0 and the mantissa bits are also 0.\r\nSo for the old code, this should be:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    if (exponent < 0 || exponent == 0 && mantissa == 0) {  // underflow: use min value\r\n      exponent = 0;\r\n      mantissa = 1;\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNow the trick is to find the most efficient way to make an equivalent fix SmallFloat","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at
