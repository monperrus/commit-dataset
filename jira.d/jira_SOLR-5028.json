Tomás: Don't quite get this. Those enums are just for use as key values in the map, not for the paths so I think they should stay.\r\nYes, I know, but what I'm saying is that as the SHF receives an unknown set of parameters (because it's a plugin) you can't generate enum keys for everything. Instead of that, when someone needs to get information about the SHF configuration it'll need to get the Node (or the PluginInfo with Alan's patch). \"connTimeout\" and \"socketTimeout\" are arguments specific to the HttpShardHandlerFactory that other SHF implementations may or may not use. Also, HttpShardHandlerFactory accepts lots of other arguments and we are not providing keys for all of them. So it gets confusing, some arbitrary init params can be get using cfg.get(...) and some can't. \r\n\r\nbq. Ryan, Tomás, could you try this out? Will work on a persistence patch next.\r\nI haven't tested it yet, but +1 on the changes you did. ConfigSolrXmlOld still populates the map with the wrong paths though.
