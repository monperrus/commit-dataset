Some explanation of the problem:\r\n\r\nIn the bind phase of ConditionalNode (NULLIF), the CAST node is generated on top of the untyped NULL and it gets the data type descriptor(DTD) of the left operand.  However, the CAST node should have DTD where its value can be nullable.  \r\n\r\nBinaryComparisonOperatorNode bcon = (BinaryComparisonOperatorNode)testCondition;\r\n\t\t\t\r\nQueryTreeNode cast = getNodeFactory().getNode(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tC_NodeTypes.CAST_NODE,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthenElseList.elementAt(0), \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbcon.getLeftOperand().getTypeServices(),  <=== not nullable!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgetContextManager());\r\n\r\nThe second query:\r\n\r\nselect nullif('x','x') as f0, f1 from a\r\n   union all\r\n   select nullif('x','x') as f0, nullif(1,1) as f1 from b; \r\n\r\nworks because it didn't generate a NormalizedResultSet on top of the PRN on the right hand side of the union since the datatype and length matches.  So it didn't hit the path where it does additional checking at execution time.\r\n\r\nFor the first query:  \r\n\r\nselect nullif('x','x') as f0, f1 from a\r\n   union all\r\n   select nullif('x','x') as f0, nullif('x','x') as f1 from b; \r\n\r\nThe union result column's length does not match with the right hand side result column, so it generated a NormalizedResultSet on top of the RHS of the union.  When the system retrieves the row from NormalizedResultSet at execution time, the normalize method is called on the DTD and checks if the source is NULL and whether its DTD is not nullable.  In this case, the SQLSTATE 23502 is thrown.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"created":"2006-10-17T15:58:00.000+0000","updated":"2006-10-17T15:58:00.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12353388/comment/12442966","id":"12442966","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yipng","name":"yipng","emailAddress":"yipng168 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yip Ng","active":true},"body":"Attaching patch derby1967-trunk-diff01.txt for review.  derbyall still running.
