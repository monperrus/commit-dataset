What happens if you change that too to EBCDIC? (We're not really supposed to change file.encoding, so that might explain why we have problems with these tests.) I'm not sure, but there may be some characters in the input files that are not possible to represent in EBCDIC so that we won't get these tests to run anyway as long as we copy the input files to the native encoding first (I don't remember, but I think that may have been the reason why we set file.encoding to UTF-8 for these tests, but apparently it didn't work as we had hoped).\r\n\r\nNow all the setting of different encoding flags in RunTest is getting very complex (derby.ui.codeset, console.encoding, file.encoding, derbyTesting.encoding all set to different values depending on platform, JVM, name of test), so I'm beginning to think that it is easier to convert these tests to JUnit and control the encoding per test, rather than trying to clean up the mess in RunTest.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2009-02-02T15:45:42.978+0000","updated":"2009-02-02T15:45:42.978+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12413546/comment/12726904","id":"12726904","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Triaged for 10.5.2.
