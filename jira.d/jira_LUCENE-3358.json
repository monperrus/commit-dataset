It is very unfortunate that the Unicode Consortium somehow ended up with a rule which is, quite frankly, undesirable. When I brought the change up with Japanese users, they were 100% against that behaviour, so it's a wonder that the standard got past the Japanese without any objections (I am, of course, assuming that they actually consulted an expert in the language.)  But breaking it up as a separate filter isn't so hard.  It's only a single Unicode area with few combining marks, so the logic is not that difficult and StandardTokenizer even marks the token as katakana for us.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=trejkaz","name":"trejkaz","emailAddress":"trejkaz at trypticon dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Trejkaz","active":true},"created":"2011-08-05T01:20:20.596+0000","updated":"2011-08-05T01:20:20.596+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12517748/comment/13079747","id":"13079747","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"{quote}\r\nIt is very unfortunate that the Unicode Consortium somehow ended up with a rule which is, quite frankly, undesirable.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI'm not concerned about this, while your users may not like it, I think we should stick by the Standard for these reasons:\r\n# its not desirable to deviate from the standard here, anyone can customize the behavior to do what they want.\r\n# its not shown that what you say is true, experiments have been done here (see below) and I would say as a default, what is happening here is just fine.\r\n# splitting this katakana up in some non-standard way leaves me with performance concerns of long postings lists for common terms.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nFor the Japanese collection (Table 4), it is not clear whether bigram generation should have\r\nbeen done for both Kanji and Katakana characters (left part) or only for Kanji characters\r\n(right part of Table 4). When using title-only queries, the Okapi model provided the best\r\nmean average precision of 0.2972 (bigram on Kanji only) compared to 0.2873 when\r\ngenerating bigrams on both Kanji and Katakana. This difference is rather small, and is even\r\nsmaller in the opposite direction for long queries (0.3510 vs. 0.3523).
