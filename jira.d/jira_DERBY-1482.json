[ Note that this is different from DERBY-438 because DERBY-438 deals with triggers that _do_ reference the blob column(s), whereas this issue deals with triggers that do _not_ reference the blob columns--but I think they're related, so I'm creating this as subtask to 438 ]. In such a case, if the trigger is fired, the blob data will be streamed into memory and thus consume JVM heap, even though it (the blob data) is never actually referenced/accessed by the trigger statement.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose we have the following DDL:\r\n\r\n    create table t1 (id int, status smallint, bl blob(2G));\r\n    create table t2 (id int, updated int default 0);\r\n    create trigger tr1 after update of status on t1 referencing new as n_row for each row mode db2sql update t2 set updated = updated + 1 where t2.id = n_row.id;\r\n\r\nThen if t1 and t2 both have data and we make a call to:\r\n\r\n    update t1 set status = 3;\r\n\r\nthe trigger tr1 will fire, which will cause the blob column in t1 to be streamed into memory for each row affected by the trigger. The result is that, if the blob data is large, we end up using a lot of JVM memory when we really shouldn't have to (at least, in _theory_ we shouldn't have to...).\r\n\r\nIdeally, Derby could figure out whether or not the blob column is referenced, and avoid streaming the lob into memory whenever possible (hence this is probably more of an \"enhancement\" request than a bug)...

It would be slightly harder to figure out if the trigger\r\naction could change the values, as it could be multiple statements.\r\n\r\nOn the face of this I only see the following possibilities:\r\n1) do the work to figure out what columns the trigger action accesses.  Then\r\n   we only need to save old/new values of those columns referenced.\r\n\r\n2) Rather than reading the lobs into memory, existing interfaces could be used\r\n   to stream the lobs to temp tables, and then save a stream reference to these.\r\n   But this still would cause a lot of overhead for a trigger that never\r\n   references the lobs.\r\n\r\n3) Define the behaviour in a subset of the cases such that we can use the\r\n   existing lob in the db, and just maintain a stream reference to it.  Somethin\r\ng like:\r\n   o after trigger uses existing lob if trigger statement does not update\r\n     lob column.  Ignore trigger action possibly changing the lob value.\r\n   o before triggers always use exising lob in db, ignores possibility of\r\n     same xact changing the lob value in trigger action.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"created":"2010-01-27T18:01:52.432+0000","updated":"2010-01-27T18:01:52.432+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12345511/comment/12805606","id":"12805606","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

Here are the findings so far.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the Derby behavior that we expect in regards to the lob columns and update triggers\r\n1)In case of an AFTER UPDATE TRIGGER on the LOB column, we expect Derby to do a deep copy of the before and after image of LOB columns in the triggering table. The reason for deep copy is the contents of LOB will be different in store before the update and after the update.  I have a java program conforming this behavior. That java program is attached and the program's name is derby1482DeepCopyAfterTriggerOnLobColumn.java\r\n2)If the AFTER UPDATE TRIGGER is defined on non-LOB column, Derby still does a deep copy of before and after image of LOB columns in the triggering table. The possible improvements that can be made to Derby is to detect somehow if there is any need to do deep copy at all if the LOB columns are not getting accessed in the TRIGGER. If they are never accessed, there is no need to any before/after update values of the LOB columns thus saving memory requirement and unnecssary time spent in doing copy. I am working on writing a test case conforming that deep copy is being done even though there is really no need to since LOB columns are not getting accessed.\r\n3)In case of BEFORE UPDATE TRIGGER, we should not be doing any deep copy because the before and after images of LOB should be same (which will be the LOB value before update was done).

I am copying the javadoc comments from the program here to show what it is doing\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * DERBY-1482 - This program shows that we are successfully doing deepcopy\r\n * of before and after images of a lob object during an after update\r\n * trigger(that is provided we are running with enough memory.) \r\n * \r\n * In case of after update trigger, we MUST do a deepcopy since the store \r\n * value of lob is going to be different before and after the update. \r\n * \r\n * There are 2 sets of test cases\r\n * 1)The first test case(runLobTest), the AFTER UPDATE TRIGGER has been defined \r\n * on LOB column which means that Derby has to have enough memory to do the \r\n * deep copy of the before and after image of the LOB column.

This problem can be easily resolved by decreasing the amount of page cache requested from the heap. This can be achieved by using the property -Dderby.storage.pageCacheSize=smallerpagecache. Once the page cache requirement is lowered derby1482Repro.java runs fine without any problems with LOB streaming. The reason we don't run into OOM for streaming of LOB with derby1482Repro.java is that the LOB data size is not big enough. derby1482Repro.java is inserting only 30K data into the 2G LOB(notice I am talking about data size and not column size. LOB column is declared as 2G but data loaded into it is only 30K). Store does not stream data out of store when the data size is less than the page size (in Derby, page size is 32K). In order for us to cause the data to be read in the memory, the data size has to be bigger. \r\n\r\nWhat we are really after is a reproducible program which runs into OOM while LOBs are being streamed into memory as part of trigger execution when the LOBs are really not needed to be streamed in because they are not being accessed/updated. I have spent some time on coming up with a repro for OOM as a result of LOB streaming. That repro is attached as derby1482ReproVersion2.java This test case runs into OOM while streaming the LOB because now the LOB data is 320M in size, much larger than the page size of 32K. Since the BLOB is so large, Store will stream it into memory, thus running into OOM). \r\nTo reproduce the problem, use the following steps\r\n1)First create the database with 3 populated tables using the attached java program \r\nderby1482ReproVersion2.java as follows \r\njava org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.lang.derby1482ReproVersion2\r\nSome information about the 3 tables \r\n   a)Table t1 has a BLOB column along with other columns. \r\n   b)Table t3 is similar to t1 but without a BLOB column \r\n   c)Table t1 has an update trigger defined on it which updates table t2 in the trigger action. \r\n   d)Table t3 also has an update trigger defined on it which also updates table t2 in the trigger action. \r\n2)To reproduce the problem of OutOfMemory, connect to the database using ij with very limited heap \r\njava -Xmx4m -Dderby.storage.pageCacheSize=40 -Dij.exceptionTrace=true org.apache.derby.tools.ij \r\nconnect 'jdbc:derby:testDB1482;create=true'; \r\n--following update of table t3 works with no problem.

Satoor","active":true},"body":"The attached patch, TriggerTests_ver1_diff.txt, includes junit test which has few test fixtures to test triggers on table with LOB columns. Each and every one of those tests run into OOM probably because we are streaming the before and after values of LOB columns even when they are not being referenced by the trigger action. More code investigation is needed to identify different trigger cases where we should not stream the LOBs. \r\n\r\nI have added this junit test, TriggerTests.java, in org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.memory package. It has been added to the _Suite in that package but has been commented for now with the following comments.\r\n        //Disable following TriggerTests until DERBY-1482 has been fixed.\r\n        //Without that fix, the test will run into OOM errors for all\r\n        //the test fixtures. This test is written for triggers defined\r\n        //on table with LOB columns. No matter whether the LoB columns\r\n        //are touched in the trigger action, it appears that Derby is\r\n        //streaming the before and after values of LOB columns. Once\r\n        //the streaming problem has been resolved, we should be able\r\n        //to uncomment the following test.\r\n        //suite.addTest(TriggerTests.suite());\r\nThe org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.memory._Suite gets run as part of the lowmem suite. lowmem suite runs all the tests in it with 16M heap. I have tweaked the page cache size for TriggerTests to 100 pages. The reason for this is that the test deals with pretty big LOBs(320M each) and we will soon run into OOM because of no memory left for page cache if we ran with the default page cache of 1000 against the 16M heap.\r\n\r\nFor now, this suite runs only in embedded mode. When I ran with network server mode, I got following error. But for now, I just want to focus on the OOM failures. Once they are fixed, we can probably look at enabling this test for network server mode.\r\njava.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Network protocol exception: actual code point, 4,692, does not match expected code point, 9,224.

Of course there were no OOMs either because we have enough heap memory to be able to stream the LOBs.

I don't fully understand the details of the store and the trigger\r\n code in the case of inserts/updates of long columns.\r\nMy comments apply on to the store side of the streaming blobs.\r\n\r\nI am not exactly sure where the blobs are coming from in the sql layer.  I\r\nthink there may be some defered update tables, so the question is if the\r\nstreams are from the original table original table or a deferred update\r\ntable.\r\n>\r\n> Can you help me understand your comment about the changing BLOB value:\r\n> \"But the stored\r\n> value of the blob could be changed before we access it, so a a stream pointer\r\nto\r\n> the original blob is not going to be valid. \"\r\n>\r\n> Who / what may change it;\r\n>  - the current transaction's update query?\r\n>   - the current transaction's trigger code?\r\n>    - other transactions?\r\n\r\nI believe both the first 2 are possibilities.  Locking should prevent any\r\nchanges to the affected row by other transactions.  So there are 2 cases:\r\n\r\n1) the current tranaction statement that causes the trigger may change the\r\n   blob.\r\n\r\n\r\n   insert - value in store table could be used to stream\r\n   delete - value in store table won't be avaliable after the delete\r\n   update - value in store table may be changed by the update itself\r\n\r\n2) the trigger action code might change the blob.\r\n\r\n   This case is more obscure and needs to happen in a procedure.  And the\r\n   only way to use the old and new values is to pass them into the procedure,\r\n   and currently our procedures don't support blobs as arguments.\r\n>\r\n>    That said, I do see that we are having trouble dealing with \"inbound stream\r\ns\" when they have to be used several times - our only tool there is to materiali\r\nze the stream into memory. One extension would be to write data to disk temporar\r\nily to avoid OOME, but I'm not sure if we can manage this without introducing a\r\nperformance degradation.\r\n>    The better option is probably to just write the value to the log and then r\r\nead it back from the log as required. Do you have any idea about how much effort\r\n that would take? I'm not suggesting that it should be done now, but it would be\r\n nice to have an idea about how difficult it is.\r\nThat sounds \"hard\" to me.  I would definitely not want to see the sql layer\r\naccessing the log.  The clean separation of sql layer from the store layer\r\nhas greatly helped the reliablity of the product.  Also timing of it might\r\nbe a problem as the current trigger code may need a second access to a stream\r\nbefore the actual value has been logged.  Again I think the key here may be\r\nin understanding the deferred update tables and how they apply to all\r\nthe matrix of before/after insert/delete/update triggers.\r\n\r\nYou also raise an interesting point about performance.

I hope to tackle that as a seperate step) During the create trigger bind time, we go through the columns referenced by the trigger action and isolate the ones which come from the new/old tables through the REFERENCING clause. The information about those columns will be saved in a new column in SYSTRIGGERS. At triggering statement execution time, we will go through SYSTRIGGERS's new column and determine which columns should be read in rather than all the columns. This should help with OOM issues involving LOB columns.\r\n\r\nWill need to work with upgrade code to support the new column in SYSTRIGGERS. At this point, I am focusing on non-upgarde code changes.\r\n\r\nI have finished the rough code changes on collecting the columns referenced in trigger action when trigger action is not a stored procedure call. The information collected would be something like [1,3] which means column numbers 1 and 3 are accessed by the trigger action. But the tricky party is to transform column 3 from triggering table to column 2 in the columns that will be read into memory. eg\r\ncreate table t1 (c11 int, c12 int, c13 int)\r\ninsert into t1 values (11,12, 13)\r\nand say there is a trigger defined on t1 which references column numbers 1 and 3 meaning columns c11 and c13. Once I finish coding the logic completely, we will read only values 11 and 13 since c12 is not referenced by the trigger action. But the way code works right now, we try to look at the columns through the column number meaning for our eg, c11 will be looked through position 1 which is good. But c13 will be looked through position 3 but really, c13 is in position 2 of the subset of the original row from t1. \r\n\r\nMy apologies if above eg is little confusing. I will try to make changes so that we look for c13 in position 2 of the subset row rather than position 3.\r\n\r\nAny feedback appreciated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

Satoor","active":true},"body":"I am attaching a patch, derby1482_patch1_diff.txt,  which is NOT READY FOR commit yet because the required upgrade work for system table change has not been done yet. If this patch is committed in it's current state, the older releases databases will fail with the trunk even with hard upgrade. I plan to work on the upgrade work soon.\r\n\r\nI ran derbyall and junit All suite with my patch. During the junite All suite run, I am getting lots of errors in the upgrade suite. The failures are attached to this jira as junitUpgradeTestFailureWithPatch1.out I think this probably is because of the new column that I have added to SYSTRIGGERS. I have not investigated this failure enough to know for sure but I will be tackling the upgrade changes soon. \r\n\r\nNext, I am planning on focusing on following tasks\r\n1)Implement Rick's suggestion of including the extra information we need about trigger in existing column SYSTRIGGERS.REFERENCEDCOLUMNS This columns is of type ReferencedColumnsDescriptorImpl and I can hopefully enhance that type to include the additional information. Hopefully this approach will make it the next task easier which is to make upgrade changes.\r\n2)Work on the upgrade code so this change in system table does not break older release databases when they are run in soft/hard upgrade mode with the suggested work done through this jira.\r\n3)Add more test cases in addition to what was added through TriggerTests.java\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind is the improvement proposed by this patch will work only for UPDATE triggers defined at row level AND they identify specific columns on which the trigger is defined. eg\r\n\tCREATE TRIGGER tr1 AFTER UPDATE OF c12 ON table1 \r\n\t    REFERENCING OLD AS oldt NEW AS newt\r\n\t    FOR EACH ROW UPDATE table2 SET c24=oldt.c14;\r\nThe trigger above is a row level UPDATE trigger and it identifies column \"c12\" as the triggering column. For all other kinds of triggers(INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE trigger defined at table leve, UPDATE trigger defined at row level but does not identify trigger columns), the improvement proposed by this patch will not kick in. That is because all the other kinds of triggers do not identify specific trigger columns. In the absence of specific trigger columns, Derby decides to fetch in all the columns from the triggering table since it doesn't know what column it might need to fetch at trigger execution time.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the description of the existing behavior and changes made through my patch. It is rather long but I wanted to provide as much information as I can since some part of the code is little tricky.\r\n\r\nI am going to work with following example to show what is being done by Derby today and what changes I am suggesting.\r\n\tCREATE TABLE table1 (c11 int, c12 int, c13 int, c14 int, c15 int);\r\n\tINSERT INTO table1 VALUES(1,2,3,4,5);\r\n\tCREATE TABLE table2 (c21 int, c22 int, c23 int, c24 int, c25 int);\r\n\tINSERT INTO table2 VALUES(2,2,3,-1,5);\r\n\tCREATE TRIGGER tr1 AFTER UPDATE OF c12 ON table1 \r\n\t    REFERENCING OLD AS oldt NEW AS newt\r\n\t    FOR EACH ROW UPDATE table2 SET c24=oldt.c14;\r\nIn the update trigger tr1 above, the trigger column is c12 and trigger action references old/new transition variable oldt.c14 Note that the trigger table, table1, has 5 columns and of those only 2 columns are really needed by the trigger tr1. The trunk code converts the trigger action UPDATE table2 SET c24=oldt.c14 to UPDATE table2 SET c24=org.apache.derby.iapi.db.Factory::getTriggerExecutionContext().getOldRow().getInt(4)\r\nNote that oldt.c14 gets referenced through it's column position in triggering table table1.\r\nNow let's consider the triggering statement\r\n\tUPDATE table1 SET c12 = -9 WHERE c11=1;\r\nThe trunk code is written to fetch all the 5 columns in trigger table table1 even though the trigger is only in need of columns c12 and c14. If in our example, if table1 had a LOB column with large amount of data, we would fetch that LOB column in memory too even though trigger does not need that column.\r\n\r\nWith my patch, I am keeping track of references to old/new transition variables in trigger action. Trunk code already keeps track of trigger columns in SYSTRIGGERS.REFERENCEDCOLUMNS. The combination of the two will tell us exactly what columns are needed for trigger execution from the triggering table and we fetch only those columns. For the trigger tr1, that would mean column c12(which is the trigger column) and column c14(which is in the trigger action). Because of this, columns c11, c13 and c15 will not be read into memory. If one or more of those columns were LOB columns, that can result in lot of performance and memory consumption improvement. My code will convert the trigger action UPDATE table2 SET c24=oldt.c14 \r\nto \r\nUPDATE table2 SET c24=org.apache.derby.iapi.db.Factory::getTriggerExecutionContext().getOldRow().getInt(2)\r\nNote that oldt.c14 get referenced through it's column position is what columns are fetched and not by it's column position in the trigger table table1. In our specific eg, we are fetching column c12 and c14 and column c14 is in the 2nd position in that set. But when we make a note of the trigger action columns in SYSTRIGGERS, we want to record it by it's column position in the trigger table to know exactly what columns we are talking about. So, for our trigger eg below, SYSTRIGGERS will look as follows\r\n\tCREATE TRIGGER tr1 AFTER UPDATE OF c12 ON table1 \r\n\t    REFERENCING OLD AS oldt NEW AS newt\r\n\t    FOR EACH ROW UPDATE table2 SET c24=oldt.c14;\r\nselect TRIGGERNAME, EVENT, TYPE, REFERENCEDCOLUMNS, REFCOLSTRIGGERACTION, TRIGGERDEFINITION from sys.systriggers;\r\nTRIGGERNAME|EVENT|TYPE|REFERENCEDCOLUMNS|REFCOLSTRIGGERACTION|TRIGGERDEFINITION\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTR1        |U    |R   |(2)              |(4)                 |update table2 set c24=oldt.c14\r\nSo, the column numbers to recognize the trigger columns and trigger action columns, we use their position in triggering table. But to convert the trigger action to org.apache.derby.iapi.db.Factory::getTriggerExecutionContext().getxxxRow().getXXX(?), for ?, we \r\nneed to use the relative column position in the columns actually fetched from triggering table. My apologies if this sounds confusing. In one of intermediate work on my machine, my code didn't account for this difference in column position in table vs column position in the columns \r\nactually fetched, and I started getting NPE because there is no column at position 4 since we are in a need to fetch only 2 columns. This 2 different column numbering scheme makes the code little tricky to follow but if we one understands the eg above, I think then it becomes easier to understand the code. I will be happy to hear if someone has ideas on may be code this differently. \r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

I have a couple comments:\r\n\r\nCreateTriggerNode:\r\n\r\no In the comments there are several references to the columns mentioned in the REFERENCING clause. I think the meaning would be a little more clear and specific if these comments talked about the columns mentioned in the trigger action.\r\n\r\no There are two places in bindReferencesClause() where -1s are squeezed out of arrays. This is done for triggerColsAndTriggerActionCols and triggerActionColsOnly. It seems to me that there is an opportunity here to factor this squeezing code into a helper method. That will make the code a little easier to read and maintain.\r\n\r\no I believe that the new code (computing the columns referenced in trigger actions and optimizing the generated text) should only be performed if the database is at level 10.6 or above.

One thing may not have been clear in my patch comments is that now, with my changes in the patch, it is possible to have referencedColumns as null but referencedColumnsInTriggerAction as not null. eg\r\n     create trigger tr1 after update on t1 referencing old as oldt  for each row values(oldt.id);\r\nFor the trigger above, the user has not provided a list of columns whose update should fire trigger tr1. Because of that, any column update from table t1 will cause trigger tr1 to fire. But the columns referenced in trigger action through old/new transiten variables is column \"id\". in other words, for this trigger, referencedColumns will be null but referencedColumnsInTriggerAction will not be null. The changes to readExternal and writeExternal will have to account for possibility of referencedColumns being null. Prior to my changes in the patch, if referencedColumns was null for a trigger, the entire object ReferencedColumnDescriptorImpl will be null and hence we will never get to these methods. The null case was handled by FormatIdOutputStream.writeObject(Object) with the following code\r\n\tpublic void writeObject(Object ref) throws IOException\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif (ref == null)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tFormatIdUtil.writeFormatIdInteger(this, StoredFormatIds.NULL_FORMAT_ID);\r\n\t\t\treturn;\r\n\t\t}\r\n                                          .........\r\n\r\nThe stack trace of such a call is as follows.\r\nThread [main] (Suspended (breakpoint at line 95 in FormatIdOutputStream))\t\r\n\tFormatIdOutputStream.writeObject(Object) line: 95\t\r\n\tUserType.writeExternal(ObjectOutput) line: 291\t\r\n\tStoredPage.logColumn(Object[], int, DynamicByteArrayOutputStream, int, int, int) line: 6243\t\r\n\tStoredPage.logRow(int, boolean, int, Object[], FormatableBitSet, DynamicByteArrayOutputStream, int, byte, int, int, int) line: 3963\t\r\n\tInsertOperation.writeOptionalDataToBuffer(RawTransaction, DynamicByteArrayOutputStream, Object[], FormatableBitSet, boolean, int, int, int) line: 370\t\r\n\tInsertOperation.<init>(RawTransaction, BasePage, int, int, Object[], FormatableBitSet, LogicalUndo, byte, int, boolean, int, DynamicByteArrayOutputStream, int, int) line: 115\t\r\n\tLoggableActions.actionInsert(RawTransaction, BasePage, int, int, Object[], FormatableBitSet, LogicalUndo, byte, int, boolean, int, DynamicByteArrayOutputStream, int, int) line: 139\t\r\n\tStoredPage(BasePage).insertNoOverflow(int, Object[], FormatableBitSet, LogicalUndo, byte, int) line: 602\t\r\n\tStoredPage(BasePage).insertAtSlot(int, Object[], FormatableBitSet, LogicalUndo, byte, int) line: 523\t\r\n\tStoredPage.insertAtSlot(int, Object[], FormatableBitSet, LogicalUndo, byte, int) line: 6723\t\r\n\tStoredPage(BasePage).insert(Object[], FormatableBitSet, byte, int) line: 629\t\r\n\tHeapController.doInsert(DataValueDescriptor[]) line: 288\t\r\n\tHeapController.insertAndFetchLocation(DataValueDescriptor[], RowLocation) line: 599\t\r\n\tTabInfoImpl.insertRowListImpl(ExecRow[], TransactionController, RowLocation[]) line: 511\t\r\n\tTabInfoImpl.insertRow(ExecRow, TransactionController) line: 420\t\r\n\tDataDictionaryImpl.addDescriptor(TupleDescriptor, TupleDescriptor, int, boolean, TransactionController) line: 1824\t\r\n\tCreateTriggerConstantAction.executeConstantAction(Activation) line: 321\t\r\n\tMiscResultSet.open() line: 61\t\r\n\tGenericPreparedStatement.executeStmt(Activation, boolean, long) line: 436\t\r\n\tGenericPreparedStatement.execute(Activation, long) line: 317\t\r\n\tEmbedStatement.executeStatement(Activation, boolean, boolean) line: 1232\t\r\n\tEmbedStatement.execute(String, boolean, boolean, int, int[], String[]) line: 625\t\r\n\tEmbedStatement.execute(String) line: 555\t\r\n\tij.executeImmediate(String) line: 367\t\r\n\tutilMain.doCatch(String) line: 521\t\r\n\tutilMain.runScriptGuts() line: 363\t\r\n\tutilMain.go(LocalizedInput[], LocalizedOutput) line: 261\t\r\n\tMain.go(LocalizedInput, LocalizedOutput) line: 229\t\r\n\tMain.mainCore(String[], Main) line: 184\t\r\n\tMain.main(String[]) line: 75\t\r\n\tij.main(String[]) line: 59\t\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

Which means for cases 3b), 3c), 3d), 4b), 4c) and 4d), we will incorrectly not read columns involved in trigger action thus causing problems. \r\n\r\nFor soft upgrade problem scenarios, 3b), 3c), 4b) and 4c), we can probably check that if we are in soft upgrade mode and if there are triggers involved, then read all the columns from the trigger table (just like what gets done today in the trunk and prior releases), no matter if they are all needed or not. This logic though will also require us to read all the columns from trigger table for case 2) above in soft upgrade mode. So, basically, we will read more columns that probably needed but nothing will be broken. Also, we do not anticipate users doing ton of work while in soft-upgrade mode.\r\n\r\nBut that still leaves issues with hard upgrade scenarios 3d) and 4d). One way to resolve the problems with 3d) and 4d) would be that during hard upgrade, find a way to recompile all the triggers so proper information gets created for them. \r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

I have taken care of all of them except 2.\r\n\r\nOne of the comment was as follows\r\n***************************************************************\r\nCreateTriggerNode: \r\no In the comments there are several references to the columns mentioned in the REFERENCING clause. I think the meaning would be a little more clear and specific if these comments talked about the columns mentioned in the trigger action. \r\n\r\nThe reason I am not directly using trigger action columns is because this deals only the trigger action columns available through the REFERENCING clause. It does not include the columns from the objects in the trigger action. To differentiate between these 2 different types of column possibilites in trigger action, I think it is better to say columns available through REFERNCING clause. I may be mistaken. Would like to know if you agree with my reasoning.\r\n***************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second comment was as follows\r\n***************************************************************\r\no This patch changes the serialized form of TriggerDescriptor. This is ok as long as we can convince ourselves that these objects are never persisted. These objects do live in the ConstantActions of query plans for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. Can we convince ourselves that the compiled forms of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements never persist across soft-upgrades? \r\n\r\nI don't completely comprehend this comment. When working with pre-10.7 dbs, my changes will not generate any information about trigger action columns available through REFERENCING clause, thus marking referencedColsInTriggerAction in TriggerDescriptor null. But I do have new changes in TriggerDescriptor's readExternal and writeExternal. \r\nWriteExternal will write 0 if trigger action columns are null\r\n\t\tif (referencedColsInTriggerAction == null)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tout.writeInt(0);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\telse\r\n\t\t{ ... write about trigger action columns\r\n\r\nReadExternal will check if there is a 0 for trigger action columns and if not found, will read trigger action columns info\r\n\t\tlength = in.readInt();\r\n\t\tif (length != 0)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\treferencedColsInTriggerAction = new int[length];\r\n\t\t\tfor (int i = 0; i < length; i++)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\treferencedColsInTriggerAction[i] = in.readInt();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nMay be I should check if I am dealing with pre-10.7 dbs, then I should not write 0 for trigger action columns and do the reverse for readExternal, meaning if dealing with pre-10.7dbs, do not look for any information about trigger action columns. Is that what you were bringing up in your comment?

If the comments still puzzle me, I'll let you know.\r\n\r\nConcerning the second comment: If the new serialized form is only used in new databases and hard-upgraded databases, then there should be no problem. There should be no problem if new trigger descriptors in soft-upgraded databases have the same serialized form as 10.6 trigger descriptors. This is the situation you want to avoid:\r\n\r\n1) You create a new trigger in a soft-upgraded database.\r\n\r\n2) Then you soft-downgrade to 10.6.\r\n\r\n3) Because the serialized form has changed, the 10.6 server raises a deserialization error (or worse) every time the new trigger fires.\r\n\r\nNote that, because this patch didn't make it into 10.6, there is now another serialization issue which we have to deal with:\r\n\r\nIn 10.5 and earlier, the objects stored in system tables were converted into strings when they were selected by clients. That is, a 10.5 or earlier server returned ReferencedColumnDescriptorImpl.toString() for the following query:\r\n\r\n   select referencedcolumns from sys.systriggers\r\n\r\nIn 10.6, the above query uses the writeExternal()/readExternal() machinery to send the ReferencedColumnDescriptor object if both the client and the server are at 10.6 or higher. That query will choke a 10.6 client when it hits a trigger with a referencing clause that is created in a 10.7 database. For this sort of problem, the Formatable machinery calls for introducing a new formatable id. In the end, this may make your serialization logic easier to read but it may not improve the situation for 10.6 clients. I think that the following will work:\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new subclass of ReferencedColumnDescriptorImpl called ReferencedColumnDescriptorImpl_7_0. That class will have its own formatable id and will serialize itself differently than the old ReferencedColumnDescriptorImpl. If one of these new classes is sent to a 10.6 client, then you will get an error looking up the formatable id. I don't know if that error will be any better or worse. We may want to add a release note saying that we don't handle this edge case gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope this answers your questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n-Rick","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2010-05-27T19:26:40.680+0000","updated":"2010-05-27T19:26:40.680+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12345511/comment/12872348","id":"12872348","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A. Satoor","active":true},"body":"Attaching patch derby1482_patch3_diff.txt which along with the core work also takes care of upgrade. Please share your comments on the patch.\r\n\r\nHere are the patch comments\r\nDERBY-1482 will improve on Derby's behavior about which columns should be read in when a trigger fires. The current behavior of Derby reads all the columns from the trigger table whether or not all the columns are needed for trigger execution. This can be troublesome when the trigger table has large data LOB columns causing Derby to run out of memory. With this patch, Derby will narrow down cases where it should be sufficient to read only a subset of columns from the trigger table.\r\neg of such a trigger would be the trigger below which has both trigger columns and trigger action columns through old/new transition variables\r\n\t * CREATE TRIGGER tr1 AFTER UPDATE OF c12 ON t1\r\n\t *    REFERENCING OLD AS oldt NEW AS newt\r\n\t *    FOR EACH ROW UPDATE t2 SET c24=oldt.j;\r\nFor a trigger like above, Derby knows exactly which columns are needed from the trigger table during trigger execution. A note of those columns to read will be made in SYSTRIGGERS table.\r\n\r\nThe general rules for what columns will be read in during a trigger execution will be as follows\r\nRule1)If trigger column information is null, then Derby will read all the columns from trigger table into memory irrespective of whether there is any trigger action column information. eg triggers\r\n            create trigger tr1 after update on t1 for each row values(1); \r\n            create trigger tr1 after update on t1 referencing old as oldt for each row insert into t2 values(2,oldt.j,-2); \r\n\r\nRule2)If trigger column information is available but no trigger action column information is found and no REFERENCES clause is used for the trigger, then read all the columns identified by the trigger column. eg trigger\r\n            create trigger tr1 after update of c1 on t1 for each row values(1); \r\n\r\nRule3)If trigger column information and trigger action column information both are not null, then only those columns will be read into memory. This will be a trigger created in 10.7 or higher level db. Because prior to that we did not collect trigger action column informatoin. eg\r\n            create trigger tr1 after update of c1 on t1 referencing old as oldt for each row insert into t2 values(2,oldt.j,-2); \r\n\r\nRule4)If trigger column information is available and no trigger action column information is found but REFERENCES clause is used for the trigger, then we will read all the columns from the trigger table. I believe that this will cover soft-upgrade and hard-\r\nupgrade scenario during trigger execution of triggers created pre-10.7. This will prevent us from having special logic of soft-upgrade. \r\nAdditionally, this logic makes invalidation of existing triggers unnecessary during hard-upgrade. The pre-10.7 created triggers will work just fine even though for some triggers, they would have trigger action columns missing. A user can choose to drop and recreate such triggers to take advantage of DERBY-1482 work which will avoid unnecssary column reads during trigger execution if the trigger action column information was available along with trigger column info. eg trigger created prior to 10.7\r\n            create trigger tr1 after update of c1 on t1 referencing old as oldt for each row insert into t2 values(2,oldt.j,-2);\r\nThe Rule4) is there to cover triggers created with pre-10,7 releases but now that database has been hard/soft-upgraded to 10.7\r\nor higher version. Prior to 10.7, we did not collect any information about trigger action columns. So, both of the 2 kinds of triggers shown above prior to 10.7 will not have any trigger action column info on them in SYSTRIGGERS table. Without our last rule about what columns should be read in, we will run into problems for soft-upgrade or hard-upgrade causing us to not read all the required columns.The trigger eg above if created prior to 10.7 mode will have trigger column and REFERENCING clause set in SYSTRIGGERS but will not have trigger action column info even \tthough there are columns referenced in trigger action through old/new transition variables. This same trigger if created in 10.7 or higher \tversion will have trigger column, REFERENCING clause and trigger action column set for it in SYSTRIGGERS. To handle this on a hard/soft-upgraded db, we will just choose to read all the columns from trigger table if SYSTRIGGER shows trigger column and REFERENCING clause for a trigger but no trigger action column. \r\n\r\nRule5)The only place we will need special code for soft-upgrade is during trigger creation. If we are in soft-upgrade mode, we want to make sure that we do not save information about trigger action columns in SYSTRIGGERS because the releases prior to 10.7 do not understand trigger action column information.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's see with examples, when the rules described above kick in\r\nConsider following 4 trigger scenarios \r\n            1) create trigger tr1 after update on t1 for each row values(1); \r\n            2) create trigger tr1 after update on t1 referencing old as oldt for each row insert into t2 values(2,oldt.j,-2); \r\n            3) create trigger tr1 after update of c1 on t1 for each row values(1); \r\n            4) create trigger tr1 after update of c1 on t1 referencing old as oldt for each row insert into t2 values(2,oldt.j,-2); \r\n\r\nAnd these different triggers could be created in following various combination of soft-upgrade, hard-upgrade, brand new db\r\n\ta)trigger is getting created in newly created 10.7 db \r\n\tb)trigger already created in the pre-10.7db before soft upgrade \r\n\tc)trigger is getting created while in soft upgrad mode with pre-10.7 db \r\n\td)trigger already created in the pre-10.7db before hard upgrade \r\n\te)trigger is getting created after pre-10.7db is hard upgraded \r\n\r\nAll the db variations for trigger scenario 1 will be covered by Rule1).\r\nAll the db variations for trigger scenario 2 will be covered by Rule1)\r\nAll the db variations for trigger scenario 3 will be covered by Rule2).\r\nFor trigger scenario 4, different rules will apply depending on db variations\r\n\tFor 4a), Rule3) will apply\r\n\tFor 4b), Rule4) will apply\r\n\tFor 4c), Rule5) will apply\r\n\tFor 4d), Rule4) will apply\r\n\tFor 4e), Rule3) will apply\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.

If I understand correctly, users should expect to see the following behaviors:\r\n\r\n1) No behavior change for legacy triggers created before 10.7 is released.\r\n\r\n2) No behavior change for triggers created in soft-upgraded databases.\r\n\r\n3) Potential performance improvement for triggers created in new 10.7 databases.\r\n\r\n4) Potential performance improvement for triggers created in legacy databases after hard-upgrade to 10.7.\r\n\r\nBefore looking into the details of this patch, I would like to explore an alternative solution. Maybe this solution has already been considered and rejected. If so, I apologize for the noise. This alternative approach would bring the performance improvement to more cases and would avoid the soft-upgrade and serialization issues. I think that it would re-use most of the code which you are supplying with the current patch:\r\n\r\nA) Do not change what is stored in SYSTRIGGERS.\r\n\r\nB) Instead, the very first time that a trigger is run, if there is a REFERENCING clause, re-parse the trigger text in order to find the columns that are actually needed.\r\n\r\nC) Store the extra referenced column information in a transient field of the trigger descriptor for use by later firings.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that the first firing of a trigger would incur an extra compilation tax. I think that this tax would not be noticed.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this approach is that the performance improvement would be seen in cases (1) and (2) above and not just in cases (3) and (4).

The issue with the earlier patch was that when in soft-upgrade mode, the patch was using the new code to do the column read optimization while generating the internal trigger action sql but when such a database goes back to it's original version, the generated trigger action sql won't work anymore because previous releases of Derby do not recognize this column read optimization. In order to fix this, the code has to be smart to see if it is working with a pre-10.9 database(which in other words means that we are in soft-upgrade mode) and if yes, then it should not use the column read optimization code during trigger action SPS regeneration and during UPDATE execution when we read limited columns from the trigger table based on what is required by the UPDATE sql and the firing triggers  I have made that change in the attached patch and now\r\nthe upgrade tests work fine.

When such a db is taken back to 10.8.2, it can run into issues because 10.8.2 doesn't recognize column read optimization performed by the next point release of 10.8 and hence genereated trigger action SPSes will not work correctly in 10.8.1.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.
