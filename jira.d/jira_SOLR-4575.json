These are the \"implicit properties\" that you can refer to in, for instance, solrconfig.xml.\r\n\r\nThe only real back-compat cost at this point is carrying around two entries for each of the listed properties in coredescriptor, e.g.\r\n\r\nname => collection1\r\nand\r\nsolr.core.name => collection1\r\n\r\nIn fact, in this example in solrconfig.xml, you could ask for\r\n<infoStream file=\"INFOSTREAM-${solr.core.name}.txt\">false</infoStream>\r\nor\r\n<infoStream file=\"INFOSTREAM-${name}.txt\">false</infoStream> \r\nand get the same results.\r\n\r\nSo with that cost I think we should put this behavior back rather than pull the rug out from under existing behavior.
