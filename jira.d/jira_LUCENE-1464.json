I think FSDir should be (remain) a simple conduit.\r\n\r\nOne improvement we could make is if you try to open an IndexReader on an FSDir for which the directory you specified does not exist, instead of saying \"no segments* files found\" we could say \"directory 'XXX' does not exist\"?  That's a more transparent error.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, that'd be a change in the API: instead of returning null from FSDir.list, we'd throw an IOException.  Maybe we could do this as part of LUCENE-1468, if we introduce a new \"listAll\" method.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2008-11-24T13:26:57.471+0000","updated":"2008-11-24T13:26:57.471+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409014/comment/12651710","id":"12651710","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 721670.\r\n\r\nI'll take up the \"throw more transparent IOException instead of returning null\" approach with LUCENE-1468.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2008-11-29T12:17:34.691+0000","updated":"2008-11-29T12:17:34.691+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409014/comment/14304835","id":"14304835","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","emailAddress":"githubbot at cord dot dk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true},"body":"Github user uschindler commented on the pull request:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/70#issuecomment-72822745\r\n  \r\n    Hi,\r\n    I checked the Lucene Core 4.8 code.
