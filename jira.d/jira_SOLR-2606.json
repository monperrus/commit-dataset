Maybe it was a mistake not enforcing it to begin with.\r\n\r\nThat ship has kind of sailed.  At this point it's really a matter of trying to do the best we can with what the users got.\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar...\r\n\r\nHistorically speaking, Solr has never enforced limits on field names except on a feature by feature basis -- so you can have any character you want in field names in your schema.xml, but some characters don't play nice with some features: whitespace or commas in field names have never worked with the \"fl\" param, many punctuation characters would cause you problems with the Lucene query parser, etc...\r\n\r\nfor sorting, the only limitation until SOLR-1297 has ever been that you can't sort on a field containing whitespace, and that naming a field \"score\" was going to cause you problems.\r\n\r\nWith SOLR-1297 the decision was sorting by function was valuable enough that \"things that look like functions\" should be parsed as functions, even though it's theoretically possible that you might have a field named \"log(price)\" (or a \"*\" dynamicField) in your schema.\r\n\r\nbut at the same time, i added logic to try and ensure that if the function parsing approach didn't produce a valid sort, it would fallback to the legacy parsing approach before assuming an error (see \"SOLR-1297.better.field.support.patch\")\r\n\r\nApparently there are some combinations that we missed.\r\n\r\nAttached patch demonstrates the problem specifically with \":\" and \"-\" in field names.\r\n\r\ngiven that rails uses \":\" in field names when using solr, and \"-\" is a pretty common character for people to expect to work in field names, we should definitely try to get to the bottom of this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2011-07-30T04:51:06.204+0000","updated":"2011-07-30T04:51:06.204+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12510747/comment/13073130","id":"13073130","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sokolov","name":"sokolov","emailAddress":"sokolov at falutin dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Sokolov","active":true},"body":"My money's on this:\r\n\r\n        // short circuit test for a really simple field name\r\n        String field = sp.getId(null);\r\n\r\nin QueryParsing.parseSort.\r\n\r\ngetId() uses isJavaIdentifer() to detect the end of a \"simple\" field name, which I'm sure can't match '-' or ':'.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sokolov","name":"sokolov","emailAddress":"sokolov at falutin dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Sokolov","active":true},"created":"2011-07-30T05:13:16.414+0000","updated":"2011-07-30T05:13:16.414+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12510747/comment/13073138","id":"13073138","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"bq.
