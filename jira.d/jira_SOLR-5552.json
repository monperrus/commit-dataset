PeerSync treats these failures as indicators that the other replicas in the shard are unavailable (or whatever) and assumes success. Here's the log message:\r\n2013-12-11 11:43:25,936 [coreLoadExecutor-3-thread-1] WARN solr.update.PeerSync - PeerSync: core=cloud_shard1_replica1 url=http://cloud85:8985/solr couldn't connect to http://cloud84:8984/solr/cloud_shard1_replica2/, counting as success\r\nThe Jetty HTTP listener doesn't start accepting connections until long after this process has completed and already selected the wrong leader.\r\nFrom what I can see, we seem to have a leader recovery process that is based partly on HTTP requests to the other nodes, but the HTTP listener on those nodes isn't active yet. We need a leader recovery process that doesn't rely on HTTP requests. Perhaps, leader recovery for a shard w/o a current leader may need to work differently than leader election in a shard that has replicas that can respond to HTTP requests? All of what I'm seeing makes perfect sense for leader election when there are active replicas and the current leader fails.\r\nAll this aside, I'm not asserting that this is the only cause for the out-of-sync issues reported in this ticket, but it definitely seems like it could happen in a real cluster.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"363739","summary":"Leader recovery process can select the wrong leader if all replicas for a shard are down and trying to recover as well as lose updates that should have been recovered.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tim.potter","name":"tim.potter","emailAddress":"tim dot potter at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Potter","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tim.potter","name":"tim.potter","emailAddress":"tim dot potter at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Potter","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":15,"total":15,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12684361/comment/13847614","id":"13847614","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tim.potter","name":"tim.potter","emailAddress":"tim dot potter at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Potter","active":true},"body":"Here's a first cut at a solution sans unit tests, which relies on a new Slice property - last_known_leader_core_url. However I'm open to other suggestions on how to solve this issue if someone sees a cleaner way.\r\n\r\nDuring the leader recovery process outlined in the description of this ticket, the ShardLeaderElectionContext can use this property as a hint to replicas to defer to the previous known leader if it is one of the replicas that is trying to recover. Specifically, this patch only applies if all replicas are \"down\" and the previous known leader is on a \"live\" node and is one of the replicas trying to recover. This may be too restrictive but it covers this issue nicely and minimizes chance of regression for other leader election / recovery cases.\r\n\r\nHere are some log messages from the replica as it exits the waitForReplicasToComeUp process that show this patch working:\r\n\r\n>>>\r\n\r\n2013-12-13 08:51:26,992 [coreLoadExecutor-3-thread-1] INFO  solr.cloud.ShardLeaderElectionContext  - Enough replicas found to continue.\r\n2013-12-13 08:51:26,992 [coreLoadExecutor-3-thread-1] INFO  solr.cloud.ShardLeaderElectionContext  - Last known leader is http://cloud84:8984/solr/cloud_shard1_replica1/ and I am http://cloud85:8985/solr/cloud_shard1_replica2/\r\n2013-12-13 08:51:26,992 [coreLoadExecutor-3-thread-1] INFO  solr.cloud.ShardLeaderElectionContext  - Found previous? true and numDown is 2\r\n2013-12-13 08:51:26,992 [coreLoadExecutor-3-thread-1] INFO  solr.cloud.ShardLeaderElectionContext  - All 2 replicas are down. Choosing to let last known leader http://cloud84:8984/solr/cloud_shard1_replica1/ try first ...\r\n2013-12-13 08:51:26,992 [coreLoadExecutor-3-thread-1] INFO  solr.cloud.ShardLeaderElectionContext  - There may be a better leader candidate than us - going back into recovery\r\n\r\n<<<\r\nThe end result was that my shard recovered correctly and the data remained consistent between leader and replica. I've also tried this with 3 replicas in a Slice and when the last known leader doesn't come back, which works as it did previously.\r\n\r\nLastly, I'm not entirely certain I like how the property gets set in the Slice constructor. It may be better to set this property in the Overseer? Or even store the last_known_leader_core_url in a separate znode, such as /collections/<COLL>/last_known_leader/shardN. I do see some comments in places about keeping the leader property on the Slice vs. in the leader Replica so maybe that figures into this as well?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tim.potter","name":"tim.potter","emailAddress":"tim dot potter at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Potter","active":true},"created":"2013-12-13T16:20:36.629+0000","updated":"2013-12-13T16:20:36.629+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12684361/comment/13848693","id":"13848693","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"I think what we want to do here is look at having the core actually accept http requests before it registers and enters leader election - any issues we find doing this should be issues anyway, as we already have this case on a ZooKeeper expiration and recovery.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2013-12-15T21:50:08.444+0000","updated":"2013-12-15T21:50:35.630+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12684361/comment/13849245","id":"13849245","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tim.potter","name":"tim.potter","emailAddress":"tim dot potter at lucidworks dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Timothy Potter","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the feedback.
