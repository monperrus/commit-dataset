They may be inlined by a JIT, if/when it decides to compile and optimize the method some time after the method has been used repeatedly. If this were a performance-critical block, I wouldn't rely on this behavior happening at all, or happening to the extent I'd like, and would help the compiler by just doing it by hand. One thing javac can do, strangely, is inline static final primitives. There's a limit to think thinking -- at some point obscuring code by hand isn't worth it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"created":"2010-05-08T07:48:27.168+0000","updated":"2010-05-08T07:48:27.168+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12464045/comment/12871896","id":"12871896","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"body":"I committed this","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"created":"2010-05-26T19:15:29.848+0000","updated":"2010-05-26T19:15:29.848+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAHOUT-392/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04avb:"}}
