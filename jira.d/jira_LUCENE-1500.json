Should it not solve the issue?\r\n\r\nThe change to highlighter (which is committed, on trunk) is simply to throw a more meaningful, checked exception (InvalidTokenOffsetsException) when the Token has out-of-bounds offsets.  On upgrading to this, this is an exception your code needs to handle.\r\n\r\nBut this issue doesn't fix the root causes that actually produce Tokens with incorrect offsets -- that's very app specific.
