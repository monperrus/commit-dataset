During the first iteration, the total counts of all prior clusters are zero. Thus the Beta calculation that drives the Dirichlet distribution that determines the mixture probabilities degenerates to beta = rBeta(1, alpha_0). Clusters that end up with points for the next iteration will overwhelm the small constants (alpha_0, 1) and subsequent new mixture probabilities will derive from beta ~=  rBeta(count, total) which is the current implementation. All empty clusters will subsequently be driven by beta ~= rBeta(1, total) as alpha_0 is insignificant and count is 0.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation ends up using beta = rBeta(alpha_0/k, alpha_0) as initial values during all iterations because the counts are all initialized to alpha_0/k.
