but don't have enough room.  cassandra can't r/m the old files until the new ones are finished (in the worst case), so it will cut down the compaction set to something it knows will fit in the remaining space.\r\n\r\nthe bug is that using subList in doCompaction is causing the java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableCollection.remove error, since like arrays.asList, the list objects returned by subList don't support remove().","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot
