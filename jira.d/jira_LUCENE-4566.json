Isn't it enough to test it once on e.g. a dummy ReferenceManager extension? The test only verifies that the listeners are called.\r\n\r\nTrue but there wasn't an existing ReferenceManager test, and it verifies they both call super.* in the override, but as stated in one of your next points, this can be done differently if the classes should be final.\r\n\r\n\r\nbq. * Should Listener be renamed to RefreshListener?\r\n\r\nThought of that aswel, but then it felt strange to have the afterClose in there too.\r\n\r\nbq. * Now that you have the listener, is there a reason for a protected afterRefresh() and afterMaybeRefresh()?

Other option is maybe to piggy back on the refresh lock in the setter maybe. Or just document it as you say\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=selckin","name":"selckin","emailAddress":"selckin at selckin dot be","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"selckin","active":true},"created":"2012-11-21T11:44:04.642+0000","updated":"2012-11-21T11:44:04.642+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616956/comment/13501893","id":"13501893","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=selckin","name":"selckin","emailAddress":"selckin at selckin dot be","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"selckin","active":true},"body":"Simpler patch, extra Refresh & CloseListener, no changes on current afterRefresh()\r\n\r\n(no tests)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=selckin","name":"selckin","emailAddress":"selckin at selckin dot be","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"selckin","active":true},"created":"2012-11-21T11:56:31.119+0000","updated":"2012-11-21T11:56:31.119+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616956/comment/13505090","id":"13505090","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Why do we need afterClose in the listener?
