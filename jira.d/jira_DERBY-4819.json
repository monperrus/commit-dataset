I don't think a SocketTimeoutException can happen here, since we haven't set a timeout on the socket, as far as I can see. Perhaps just let the SocketTimeoutException be handled by the IOException handler? Actually, I think it would be fine to handle the ClassNotFoundException the same way as IOException too, since that would indicate that the slave is not well-behaved.\r\n\r\nI didn't quite understand the comment about a clear failure at the time of the error rather than a subsequent NPE. With a clear failure, did you have something other in mind than logging the error? Since this is running in a separate thread, I don't think there's much else we can do. I don't see the potential for a NPE since we break out of the loop and stop the thread immediately after we've set msgReceiver to null.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-09-24T08:02:26.842+0000","updated":"2010-09-24T08:02:26.842+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12474989/comment/12914378","id":"12914378","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"It turns out that the msgReceiver field that's set to null in the error handler is not actually used except locally in startMessageReciverThread().
