This could happen if an exception is thrown, but I wasn't able to prove that an exception was thrown. The close method is called. This then tries to uninstall bundles that are already in the uninstalled state. So I've added the following fixes in:\r\n\r\n1) Don't try to uninstall and uninstalled bundle\r\n2) If an exception occurs move onto the next bundle\r\n3) Clear bundles from the list even if an exception occurs as we go down.\r\n4) Syncronization between unbind and close\r\n\r\nThis appears to solve the problem I was having (at least I haven't seen it since which given it was intermittent before isn't saying much).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=not","name":"not","emailAddress":"not at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=not&avatarId=10384"},"displayName":"Alasdair Nottingham","active":true},"created":"2011-10-28T12:53:09.425+0000","updated":"2011-10-28T12:53:09.425+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ARIES-768/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0stcn:"}}
