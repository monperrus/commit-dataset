That is, using the -jvmflags=-Xjit:count:0  with an ibm 15 jvm worked for me on Windows, but not on Linux. The problem was that somehow, adding quotes as was done in RunList.java caused the jvm on (at least) Linux to think a class name was being passed in. Because I couldn't work my way through this bug fast enough this issue was handled separately in bug DERBY-1444.\r\n\r\n- I noticed that 123 of the .java tests do the following ij invocation: \r\n\tij.getPropertyArg(argv); \r\n  This makes the .java test look at a properties file listed with -p. And this explains why even with a .java test the harness passes on a -p <test_app.properties> to the jvm.\r\nI have no idea how many of these tests actually depend on the properties in the _app.properties files, but getting rid of the _app.property file for .java files could get pretty involved.\r\n\r\n- one requirement for use of jvmflags is twofold:\r\n- to pass on any and all flags and have them be added to whatever flags are already present\r\n- to overwrite specific flags that have been set in any kind of property file (with precedence rule: commandline over suite properties over derby.properties or test_app.properties).\r\n\r\nJvmflags are hard to deal with because they can be non-standard, and can be used to mean anything.\r\nFor instance, the -Dpropertykey=propertyvalue is pretty standard, and the harness could go through the list in jvmflags, evaluate wether the propertykey is already present, and let the commandline item overwrite the suite setting overwrite the test setting. But if we're talking about a -Xmx value, or like the -mx512M, the harness would need special knowledge about that to overwrite settings for that. \r\nJudging from the mechanisms in place, the folks initially creating the harness gave a swing at doing this, but it looks like it doesn't quite work correctly. (see Raman's report re -mx etc).\r\nHowever, there is no logic in place to evaluate this in the test harness. I assume the jvm has some logic - i.e. if a jvm is confronted with two -X values, what does it take? If a jvm that accepts -Xmx as well as -mx, and both properties are passed in, and they're different, what will get used?\r\n\r\nAnother question, is try to totally revamp the test property mechanisms in place, or just try to make something work for now. There are currently three sort of properties that get passed about from RunSuite via Runlist to RunTest: \r\n- jvmflags\r\n- testJavaFlags\r\n- testSpecialProps\r\nNot all of these get passed on correctly or appropriately. The entire handling is severly convoluted because RunTest itself adds things to the local variable jvmflags, and because it tries to evaluate jvmflags as well for test harness properties.\r\n\r\nThe harness (RunTest/jvm.java) currently adds -D to jvmflags not starting with -X or -D.\r\n\r\nThe harness currently adds some jvmflags to both the test_app.properties file and to the commandline for the jvm.\r\n\r\nThe harness (RunTest/SpecialFlags.java) currently splits the jvmflags into either ij-related properties, to go into the <test>_app.properties file, and 'server'-related properties (apparently any starting with 'derby'), which (?) either get passed on to the jvm or get placed into the derby.properties file.\r\nIt's not clear what happens to properties that don't start with ij nor derby.\r\n\r\nRunTest.java (for multi tests) and NetServer.java explicitly set the mx and ms values if jvmflags doesn't have anything for them...but it's looking for the -ms or -mx value, not for the now also valid -Xmx or -Xms...\r\n\r\nAfter lengthy (and including various abortive derbyall runs) this is my plan:\r\n- for now, leave the testJavaFlags and testSpecialProps unchanged, but no longer use them in any tests/suite properties, instead, use jvmflags. document.\r\n- leave the <test>_app.properties in place (even though it's counter-intuitive to use ij in a .java test) because of the limitations to the length of a commandline string on windows platform (I don't actually know what the limits are, but I know it's there).\r\n- make jvmflags property take a '^' separated list rather than a space-separated list as a propertyvalue, which gets converted into a space-separated list in the local variable in RunTest.java. \r\ni.e. you pass the properties like so:[ -Djvmflags=-Da=1^-Db=2^-Xblah^-yo  ] to RunSuite/RunTest. \r\n- modify padding with 'D'to only when there is no '-'\r\n- make the command line flags be passed after the suite flags and the suite flags after the test flags, so that the jvm follows the desired precedence of commandline-suite-test because the jvm (supposedly) picks up the 'last' setting. \r\n- for harness properties (properties the harness evaluates) ensure this sequence is kept in mind too - to ensure precedence/overwriting.\r\n- adjust NetServer and RunTest to check for -Xmx and -Xms as well as -mx and -ms\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2006-06-27T04:42:48.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-27T04:42:48.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12330003/comment/12419144","id":"12419144","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"Attaching a patch - DERBY-1091_20060702.* - which:\r\n- as planned leaves testJavaFlags and testSpecialProps unchanged, except for correcting some illogical reference to testflags in RunSuite; leaves the <test>_app.properties in place; makes jvmflags a '^' separated list rather than a space-separated list as a propertyvalue, which gets converted into a space-separated list in the local variable in RunTest.java.; modify padding with 'D'to only when there is no '-' ; make the command line flags be passed after the suite flags and the suite flags after the test flags, so that the jvm follows the desired precedence of commandline-suite-test because the jvm (supposedly) picks up the 'last' setting; adjust NetServer and RunTest to check for -Xmx and -Xms as well as -mx and -ms \r\n- in addition modified README.htm to document this\r\n- modified the test properties files where jvmflags was used.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if people that use/need to use specific jvmflags in their testing could verify this patch works as expected.\r\n\r\nNote: derbyall passed on linux - except for some odd java.util.PropertyPermission read errors on user.dir, which appear to be related to the jvm release I was running (ibm 142 build cxia32142-20060421 (SR5)).
