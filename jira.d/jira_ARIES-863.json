ARIES-727 switched from the ReferenceRecipe calling the getService() method on BluePrintContainerImpl to calling getService() itself. I believe the reason was to allow different bundle contexts to be used for some references and reference lists, to support namespace handlers adding service references. ARIES-816 re-introduced a doPrivileged block, but using the privileges of the blueprint code, not the managed bundle. \r\n\r\nI think in the case where a reference uses a different bundle context, the lookup should probably be done with the privileges of the bundle which can 'see' the service.\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"166172","summary":"Blueprint container needs to use bundle's permissions, not its own permissions, for looking up services","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cumminsh%40uk.ibm.com","name":"cumminsh@uk.ibm.com","emailAddress":"cumminsh at uk dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Holly Cummins","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cumminsh%40uk.ibm.com","name":"cumminsh@uk.ibm.com","emailAddress":"cumminsh at uk dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Holly Cummins","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":1,"total":1,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595569/comment/13399347","id":"13399347","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cumminsh%40uk.ibm.com","name":"cumminsh@uk.ibm.com","emailAddress":"cumminsh at uk dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Holly Cummins","active":true},"body":"Now fixed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cumminsh%40uk.ibm.com","name":"cumminsh@uk.ibm.com","emailAddress":"cumminsh at uk dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Holly Cummins","active":true},"created":"2012-06-22T14:43:29.360+0000","updated":"2012-06-23T15:33:52.459+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ARIES-863/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0sszb:"}}
