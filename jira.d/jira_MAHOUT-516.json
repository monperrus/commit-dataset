But here are my thoughts on a more permanent solution:\r\n\r\nIn reading up a little further on the low-rank approximations of the eigencuts paper, it appears that, at least for images, the eigenvalues follow a linear decrease from 1, i.e. each corresponding eigenvalue is <= the previous according to some approximately linear function. In perturbing the flow of probability in the underlying markov transition graph (in order to determine where the clusters are), any eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs that fall under a certain threshold (specified by a combination of epsilon and beta, which are command-line arguments) are ignored. Thus, since the eigenvalues are monotonically decreasing, in theory we'd only need to find which eigenvalue falls beneath the threshold and perform a full decomposition up to that point.\r\n\r\nThere's an obvious implementation problem there: we can't really know what that minimum degree is without performing a full decomposition in the first place. Is there a way around this? Do we have an efficient way of calculating, or perhaps approximating, eigenvalues without computing corresponding eigenvectors or otherwise performing a full decomposition? Maybe we could even do this probabilistically by \"sampling\" from the space of eigenvalues to make a guess on what rank we want? Just throwing ideas out here until the experts respond :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=magsol","name":"magsol","emailAddress":"magsol at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shannon Quinn","active":true},"created":"2010-10-22T00:32:53.205+0000","updated":"2010-10-22T00:32:53.205+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12475548/comment/12982680","id":"12982680","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"body":"Shannon do you have a patch for the arg? that sounds like a fine short-term improvement.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"created":"2011-01-17T15:54:24.803+0000","updated":"2011-01-17T15:54:24.803+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12475548/comment/12982982","id":"12982982","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=magsol","name":"magsol","emailAddress":"magsol at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shannon Quinn","active":true},"body":"Attached patch simply adds an argument to the Eigencuts algorithm to specify the desired rank of the eigendecomposition.\r\n\r\nStill working with the algorithm's author to draw up a method of calculating the desired rank.

It seems for me that in EigencutsDriver.java on the line 134: \"Matrix eigenVectors = new DenseMatrix(overshoot, eigenrank);\" should be replaced with Matrix eigenVectors = new DenseMatrix(overshoot, dimensions); as the algorithm trims down the eigenvectors after DistributedLanczosSolver finishes eigenDecomposition. I believe that this part of the code should be identical with the SpectralKmeansDriver and therefore mentioned line should be replaced. I have used Mahout recently and I am just getting familiar with it, therefore its possible that my observation is wrong.
