script attached to DERBY-2151, and that the script somehow messed up the conversion.\r\n\r\nThe first line of the comment mentions DERBY-1589, but a) there is a question mark after it, and b) the

nice...","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"37339","summary":"Test
