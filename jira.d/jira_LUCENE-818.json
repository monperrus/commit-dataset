That's not a big deal in some cases, but in anything that could be in an inner loop, it is a big deal.  We already have reports of simple things like isDeleted() being a bottleneck on servers with many CPUs and concurrent threads because of the synchronization.

Is this the Java memory model issue?\r\n\r\nYes, but it's not a problem with the Java memory model, it's more of a feature.  Threads in general have this problem (or perform very poorly if they don't).  It's also very much about compiler optimizations as well.  The optimizer may stuff a value in a register, and never check it's location in main-memory, and never see the changes.  Even if it doesn't then you drop down to problems with the CPU and cache + memory architectue in SMP systems.  Some systems require explicit memory barriers or cache flushes to see memory changes from another CPU.  One CPU writes to a spot in memory, and absent any special instructions, another CPU reading from that spot in memory may not see the change.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot

perhaps an alternative would be to catch all exceptions inside public methods and wrap them if not closed, ie...\r\n\r\n   public Foo somePublicMethod() throws IOException {\r\n       try {\r\n

Here's the relevant excerpt:\r\n\r\n> 3. RAMDirectory related changes\r\n>   It took me something to find this out. Previously, after\r\n>     ramDirectory = new RAMDirectory(file)\r\n>   I could ramDirectory.close() to release the resources. And later, I\r\n> could do a check for IndexReader.indexExists(ramDirectory) to see if\r\n> there is an index in the directory. FSDirectory behaves this way also.\r\n>   But with lucene 2.2, NullPointerExceptions came out. It turns out\r\n> when ramDirectory.close(), the instance variable fileMap is set to\r\n> null. And IndexReader.indexExists(ramDirectory) is reading fileMap to\r\n> look for indexes, causing the NPE.\r\n\r\nIn fact the original user's list email that started this bug was also\r\ndue to RAMDirectory setting its fileMap to null, but in that case, it\r\nwas via IndexWriter so detecting that IndexWriter is closed would\r\nprevent that one.\r\n\r\nIn this case the developer is using a RAMDirectory directly.\r\n\r\nI think this is an example where \"nulling things out on close\" leads\r\nto developer confusion.  Previously RAMDirectory functioned fine after\r\nbeing closed(); now, it throws a hard to understand (unless you are\r\nfamiliar w/ Lucene's sources & what specifically we changed in 2.1)\r\nNPE.\r\n\r\nI think we should fix this?\r\n\r\nSince RAMDir's public methods are fairly hot (eg heavily used building\r\nsingle-doc RAM segment), we can use Hoss's neat approach and\r\nspecifically catch the NPE and rethrow as an AlreadyClosedException?\r\n\r\nI don't mind if the \"after close semantics\" is \"it works just like it\r\ndid when it was open\" (ie, close is a no-op).  I also don't mind if\r\nyou get a \"fail-fast\" quick AlreadyClosedException.  But I think\r\nanything in between (NPE or other undefined, intermittant exceptions)\r\nonly confuses our developers.\r\n\r\nLooking at FSDirectory, it continues to work fine after close with the\r\none spooky exception that it may have been removed from the\r\nDIRECTORIES hashtable, which means if you then open the same canonical\r\npath again you get a different FSDirectory instance.  The comment\r\nstates \"this permits synchronization on directories\", but I don't see\r\nwhere in Lucene we are relying on this?  Ie, what could break if a\r\nuser keeps using a closed FSDirectory thus possibly having more than\r\none FSDirectory instance for a given canonical path?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2007-03-08T09:27:03.155+0000","updated":"2007-03-08T09:27:03.155+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363642/comment/12479357","id":"12479357","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"> we can use Hoss's neat approach and\r\n> specifically catch the NPE and rethrow as an AlreadyClosedException? \r\n\r\nI'm not enough of an expert to know if this would be faster or slower than a simple fileMap==null check.\r\nI would guess it depends on what needs to be set up in the stack frame to potentially catch an exception, and if the try/catch/throw code prevents any optimizations (such as inlining).\r\n\r\nAlso, catching a NPE seems a little icky to me... so w/o more info I'd lean toward a fileMap==null check (if anything).\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2007-03-08T16:56:38.818+0000","updated":"2007-03-08T16:56:38.818+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12363642/comment/12479373","id":"12479373","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"> I'm not enough of an expert to know if this would be faster or slower than a simple fileMap==null check.\r\n> I would guess it depends on what needs to be set up in the stack frame to potentially catch an exception, and if the try/catch/throw code prevents any optimizations (such as inlining).\r\n> \r\n> Also, catching a NPE seems a little icky to me... so w/o more info I'd lean toward a fileMap==null check (if anything).\r\n\r\nOK, good points.
