Instead use {{schema.getResourceLoader().findClass(implName, PreAnalyzedParser.class);}}\r\n* minor: you're using 4-spaces indent instead of 2 in the main value loop in your URP\r\n* in those log.debug() calls, it's creating the string to potentially not even log it.  Instead use this feature of SLF4J: {{log.debug(\"Ignoring stored part - field '{}' is not stored.\", sf.getName());}}  So few people use that great feature of SLF4J and instead rely on more bulky surrounding conditionals.\r\n* When you call sf.createFields(o, 1.0f) in the URP, isn't this doing analysis -- the very analysis that you're trying to avoid by pre-analyzing?  It is.  And isn't 'o' the JSON or similar representation of the analyzed token stream, and thus shouldn't be passed in here?  When I run your test, I get a logged error because of this, actually.  Stepping through with a debugger further validated this.  This must be remedied.  Looking at what FieldType.createField() is doing, I propose you do the same in this URP:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\norg.apache.lucene.document.FieldType newType = new org.apache.lucene.document.FieldType();\r\n    newType.setIndexed(field.indexed());\r\n    newType.setTokenized(field.isTokenized());\r\n    newType.setStored(field.stored());\r\n    newType.setOmitNorms(field.omitNorms());\r\n    newType.setIndexOptions(getIndexOptions(field, val));\r\n    newType.setStoreTermVectors(field.storeTermVector());\r\n    newType.setStoreTermVectorOffsets(field.storeTermOffsets());\r\n    newType.setStoreTermVectorPositions(field.storeTermPositions());\r\n//getIndexOptions() is:\r\n    IndexOptions options = IndexOptions.DOCS_AND_FREQS_AND_POSITIONS;\r\n    if (field.omitTermFreqAndPositions()) {\r\n      options = IndexOptions.DOCS_ONLY;\r\n    } else if (field.omitPositions()) {\r\n      options = IndexOptions.DOCS_AND_FREQS;\r\n    } else if (field.storeOffsetsWithPositions()) {\r\n      options = IndexOptions.DOCS_AND_FREQS_AND_POSITIONS_AND_OFFSETS;\r\n    }\r\n//then what createField() does is:\r\n    Field f = new Field(name, val, type);\r\n    f.setBoost(boost);\r\n{code}\r\nThis won't work for all field types (e.g. numbers) but it will for TextField (the one with analysis!) and could potentially for a custom FieldType.  I don't think we should put much if any work into supporting other FieldTypes.\r\n\r\nThe resulting \"Field\" instance can be shared from one document to the next I believe, and so you can cache this in the URP and reset its value & tokenStream.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2013-04-03T16:21:19.792+0000","updated":"2013-04-03T16:21:19.792+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639392/comment/13622080","id":"13622080","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ab","name":"ab","emailAddress":"ab at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrzej Bialecki ","active":true},"body":"Thanks again for a thorough review.

The problem is that SchemaField.isTokenized() has package-level visibility so it's not visible in the UP's package. I fixed this by providing a utility method in PreAnalyzedField to create a FieldType. Also, I moved there the chunk of logic for setting / resetting the Field content and type flags based on SchemaField. Overall, it simplifies the UP.\r\n\r\nbq. The resulting \"Field\" instance can be shared from one document to the next I believe, and so you can cache this in the URP and reset its value & tokenStream.\r\n\r\nHmm, this doesn't seem feasible at all. First, this cache would have to be thread safe, and prevent reuse of Field instances until the document is actually processed by IndexWriter - I don't think there's a mechanism to enforce this in the context of this class? Also it would have to cache multiple instances of Field, because processing a single document may result in creating multiple instances (at least one per pre-analyzed field, more if fields are multi-valued).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ab","name":"ab","emailAddress":"ab at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrzej Bialecki ","active":true},"created":"2013-04-04T12:21:04.365+0000","updated":"2013-04-04T12:21:04.365+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639392/comment/13622621","id":"13622621","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"body":"I like how your refactoring has clarified the logic in the URP.  And I like your new PreAnalyzedUpdateProcessorFactory.createFieldType() method.\r\n\r\nI think you're right that sharing Field instances isn't such a good idea after all.\r\n\r\n* minor: in the URP, \"for (Object o : src.getValues()) {\" can be \"for (Object o : src) {\"  since it implements Iterable, and for the single-value case avoids redundant collection wrapping.\r\n\r\nThe remaining thing I'm thinking of is wether PreAnalyzedUpdateProcessorFactory.createFieldType() should move down into Solr's FieldType where it can be re-used so we don't duplicate this code.  Seems pretty clear this is a good idea.  Then, I'm wondering if these Lucene FieldType instances could be cached on Solr's SchemaField so that they don't have to be needlessly re-created for each indexed value that runs through Solr.  The only obstacle I see to this is that getIndexOptions(field,val) takes the value, and if that value were to alter the logic then the FieldType can't be shared.  This is a protected method and I don't see anything that overrides it, and the default implementation doesn't use the value.  I'll create another issue for that; I can get off track easily and try to fix the world in one issue :-)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2013-04-04T18:26:31.503+0000","updated":"2013-04-04T18:26:31.503+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639392/comment/13622672","id":"13622672","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ab","name":"ab","emailAddress":"ab at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrzej Bialecki ","active":true},"body":"bq. minor: in the URP, \"for (Object o : src.getValues()) {\" can be \"for (Object o : src) {\" since it implements Iterable\r\n\r\nI'll fix this before committing.
