This means that the slave server can't open derby.log for writing since it's already opened by the master server. (Does this fact get logged to the console?) \r\n\r\nThe patch sets the working directory for the slave correctly to the \"db_slave\" directory. \r\n\r\nSInce the fix is done in the replication test ReplicationRun superclass, other replication tests suffer from the same problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
