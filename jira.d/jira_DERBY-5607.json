This patch changes the way that the NATIVE authentication service opens a connection to Credentials DB when system-wide privileges need to be authenticated. Previously, the service called in through the Derby DataSources, which in turn called through the JDBC api. The deadlock occurred in that call through the JDBC api which happened inside the user's original JDBC call. That approach is replaced: now the NATIVE authentication service opens a connection to the Credentials DB using Derby's own InternalDriver, skipping the need for a nested call through JDBC.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, the NASTHang test case now runs correctly on Java 5.\r\n\r\nI have run the NativeAuthenticationServiceTest successfully on the following platforms:\r\n\r\n1) Java 6 on Mac OSX.\r\n\r\n2) Java 5 on Linux.\r\n\r\n3) CDC/FP 1.1 on OJEC.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of those successful runs, I have committed this patch at subversion revision 1242105.
