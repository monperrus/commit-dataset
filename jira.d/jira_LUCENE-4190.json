Currently today,\r\na codec can name files pretty much whatever it wants (it must avoid _seg.cfs and segments_seg and segments.gen of course).\r\n \r\nIn general other than exceptional cases, we know which files a codec owns because\r\na codec writes the list of files that it uses for a segment into the SegmentInfo (http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0-ALPHA/core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/lucene40/Lucene40SegmentInfoFormat.html).\r\n\r\nThe problem is these exceptional cases: how can IndexFileDeleter distinguish between leftover partially written index files for a segment and some files of the user, since it may not have the SegmentInfo (.si) for that segment?\r\n\r\nPrevious attempts at this still didnt work well:\r\n* listing the extensions() in the codec is not great, e.g. Sep codec uses .doc extension for documents!\r\n* having the codec list the files it uses for a segment isnt easy and causes a mess: previously files() had to be symmetric at read and write time and we often had bugs in this, because the files used by the codec often depends upon various things like options the user chooses (e.g. did they enable term vectors, payloads, etc etc). I will do *anything* to prevent this from coming back!\r\n\r\nSo in my opinion, the only real, third option is to restrict what file names a codec can use, in a way thats not a huge imposition to the codec.
