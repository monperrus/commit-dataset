Yes, that change is probably not a good general solution, but it worked well for our usecase. It might be nice to have support for unloadable classes optional.\r\n\r\nAs I said, a change in AttributeSource or VirtualMethod is not needed, the number of total per-JVM references there are in the number of 10s. This is perfectly fine code and nobody needs to change anything. No need for \"optional\" class unloading. *Not* using weak references here would be a major design issue and a large leak.\r\n\r\nbq. In any case, if the useUnmap is false, then it seems unnecessary to even add references to the clones to the map.\r\n\r\nRobert and me were discussing about that already, we can do that, this patch is easy. We can offer that as an option (the no-unmap option), with the backside of e.g. windows can no longer delete index files unless they are garbage collected and especially higher disk usage while indexing.\r\n\r\nI did some testing with various JDKs on windows 64 bit, using a loop that clones one indexinput over and over. This loop runs successful for hours without OOM, so there is no cleanup problem, ReferenceQueues are working correctly. With a heap size of 512 MB and this simple loop, the number of Weak references is between 5000 and 600,000. But indeed, there are some GC pauses (in JDK 6 and 7). The reason for this is: Weak referees are a little bit more \"reachable\" than unreachable objects, so GC let them survive for a longer time than unreachable ones. There is nothing we can do against that. The main problem in your case maybe the really large heap size: why do you need it?\r\n\r\nMy second test was to close every cloned index input (trunk/4.x only, where the commit you mentioned was added by me one week ago), in that case the number of references was of course a static \"1\" :-) In this test, no GC pauses occurred and the test ran faster.\r\n\r\nIn my final test I disabled the put() to the WeakIdentityMap completely, in that case it was again faster, but this was caused more by the complete non-existence of any locking or maintenance of the ConcurrentHashMap.\r\n\r\nThe times for 300 million clones:\r\n- With default Lucene 4.x/trunk, no close of clones _(Lucene never closes clones and thats almost impossible to add)_: 200 secs, GC pauses\r\n- With closing clones: 65 secs\r\n- Without any map: 40 secs\r\n\r\n(JDK 6u32, windows, 64 bit, server vm, default garbage collector)\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n  // for this test, make the clones map in ByteBufferIndexInput public/package-private/...\r\n  public void testGC() throws Exception {\r\n    MMapDirectory mmapDir = new MMapDirectory(_TestUtil.getTempDir(\"testGC\"));\r\n    IndexOutput io = mmapDir.createOutput(\"bytes\", newIOContext(random()));\r\n    io.writeVInt(5);\r\n    io.close();\r\n    IndexInput ii = mmapDir.openInput(\"bytes\", IOContext.DEFAULT);\r\n    int hash = 0;\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 300*1024*1024; i++) {\r\n      final IndexInput clone = ii.clone();\r\n      hash += System.identityHashCode(clone);\r\n      if (i % (10*1024) == 0) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Number of clones: \" + ((ByteBufferIndexInput) ii).clones.size());\r\n      }\r\n      //clone.close();\r\n    }\r\n    ii.close();\r\n    mmapDir.close();\r\n  }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIn any case, we can allow user to disable unmap, but we then have to keep the weak references to the clones when unmapping is enabled, unless we add close() of clones to Lucene everywhere...\r\n\r\nSome other ideas are: Reuse the ByteBufferIndexInput instances, so we dont need to recreate them all the time. I have no idea how to do that, because we have no close() to release those, which brings us back to that problem again.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-01-31T18:45:27.420+0000","updated":"2013-01-31T18:45:27.420+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12630159/comment/13568007","id":"13568007","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=krka","name":"krka","emailAddress":"kristofer dot karlsson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kristofer Karlsson","active":true},"body":"Agree that the weakreferences for classes is probably a very minor part of it, and very unlikely part of the problem here.\r\n\r\nThe unmap option is nice, and you could make it less complicated by simply disallowing the option to be changed after the mmapdirectory has ever been cloned.

If it is only some null check, we may add it, but its risky for performance too.\r\n\r\nMy ide was that the master creates some boolean[1] and passes this boolen[1] array to all childs.

That might lead to memory leaks unless weakreferences are used, so maybe that's not actually an improvement.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=krka","name":"krka","emailAddress":"kristofer dot karlsson at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kristofer Karlsson","active":true},"created":"2013-02-02T22:09:48.879+0000","updated":"2013-02-02T22:09:48.879+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12630159/comment/13683594","id":"13683594","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"bq.

In that case you can pass unmap=\"false\" as parameter to your MMapDirectoryFactory in Solr. If the index does not change too often, the overhead by a delay in unmapping the files at a lter stage does not matter. GC has less to do then.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-06-14T17:47:41.146+0000","updated":"2013-06-14T17:47:41.146+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12630159/comment/13716741","id":"13716741","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"body":"Bulk close resolved 4.4 issues","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2013-07-23T18:37:05.383+0000","updated":"2013-07-23T18:37:05.383+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-4740/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1hm27:"}}
