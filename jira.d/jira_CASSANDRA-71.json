(Keys are returned in the order defined by the partitioner collation.)  The fundamental approach (in table.getKeyRange) is simple: create a CollatedIterator [See http://commons.apache.org/collections/api/org/apache/commons/collections/IteratorUtils.html#collatedIterator(java.util.Comparator,%20java.util.Collection)] that will return unique keys from different sources, each of which is already sorted.  Then we just need Iterators for different key sources.  \r\n\r\nFor SSTables, this means adding seekTo and an Iterator interface to FileStruct.  For Memtable, this means adding a DestructivePQIterator since unlike SSTable keys those are not inherently ordered already.  This means that we only do M log N work sorting the memtable keys where M is the number of keys we actually read, and N is the total number of keys, where a naive sort-everything-first iterator would be N log N.\r\n\r\nThis does not implement ranges spanning multiple nodes.

It seems to me that directly adding an iterator interface to FileStruct makes the class confusing, since there are now two sets of iterator interfaces and it's not clear which is which. I'd prefer leaving the current FileStruct interface as it is and  making FileStruct an input to FileStructIterator or creating a FileStruct inside FileStructIterator.\r\n5. In FileStructIterator, the keys iterated could still be smaller than startKey. So you need to check them.\r\n6. I am not sure if it's a good idea to hide IOExceptions in FileStructIterator.

(Keys are returned in the order defined by the partitioner collation.)  The fundamental approach (in table.getKeyRange) is simple: create a CollatedIterator that will return unique keys from different sources, each of which is already sorted.  Then we just need Iterators for different key sources.  For SSTables, this means adding seekTo and an Iterator interface to FileStruct.  For Memtable, this means adding a DestructivePQIterator since unlike SSTable keys those are not inherently ordered already.  This means that we only do M log N work sorting the memtable keys where M is the number of keys we actually read, and N is the total number of keys, where a naive sort-everything-first iterator would be N log N.\r\n\r\nThis does not yet implement range queries spanning multiple nodes.\r\n\r\npatch by jbellis;
