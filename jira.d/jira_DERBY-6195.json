The rows in the array are still shared between the original and the clone, so if a value in the cloned array is changed, it will be changed in the original array too. So I think we need some sort of deep clone method to properly encapsulate the multi-dimensional arrays.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding field in impl.sql.compile.ParseException was encapsulated by making the class package private, so that the field wasn't exposed to other modules. Unfortunately, impl.tools.ij.ParseException cannot be made package private just like that, since a dependency on it has leaked out to MultiTest. It might be possible to hide that exception for MultiTest, though. And I think MultiTest isn't used anymore, now that stress.multi has been converted to JUnit, so we may be able to get rid of it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2013-04-23T10:16:59.102+0000","updated":"2013-04-23T10:16:59.102+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12643950/comment/13639017","id":"13639017","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Thanks for that advice, Knut.
