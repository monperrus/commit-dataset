Our performance engineer reports:\r\n\r\nThe following stack shows items being evicted from Derby's container cache.  Extra debug code showed that the cache was at its maximum size (100), and that about 1 in 25 accesses to the cache was resulting in a miss (forcing another item to be evicted).  Since this results in synchronous disk write, performance is bottlenecked on IO.  Patching Derby to allow the cache to grow to 200 entries solved the performance problem.\r\n\r\nPerformance is severely degraded.  CPU utilization is low -- performance is IO bound.
