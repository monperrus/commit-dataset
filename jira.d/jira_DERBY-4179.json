(I could not find\r\n  any other such test).\r\n\r\n* Fixed JUnit harness to correctly fork a Sun phoneME vm (image name\r\n  is cvm, not java),\r\n\r\n* Added logic to capture what happens to minion (if it fails) by\r\n  capturing its stderr (if it ever gets started, that is), cf. example enclosed.\r\n\r\n* Added socket logic to communicate to parent when minion has booted\r\n  the \"dual boot\" candidate to avoid having to wait for 30 seconds or\r\n  more to be sure it has done so. Test now runs in a few seconds.\r\n\r\n* Skips test for j9 for now, since this platform fails on the fork\r\n  operation according to Kathey. I suggest we open a new JIRA to fix\r\n  this if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of the minion failing:\r\n-----------------------------\r\nThere was 1 failure:\r\n1) testBootLock(org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.store.BootLockTest)junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Minion did not start or boot db in 60 seconds.\r\n----Minion's stderr:\r\njava.lang.Exception: Stack trace\tat java.lang.Thread.dumpStack(Thread.java:1206)\tat org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.store.BootLockMinion.main(BootLockMinion.java:48)\r\n----Minion's stderr ended\r\n\tat org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.store.BootLockTest.testBootLock(BootLockTest.java:201)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\r\n\tat org.apache.derbyTesting.junit.BaseTestCase.runBare(BaseTestCase.java:109)\r\n\tat junit.extensions.TestDecorator.basicRun(TestDecorator.java:24)\r\n\tat junit.extensions.TestSetup$1.protect(TestSetup.java:21)\r\n\tat junit.extensions.TestSetup.run(TestSetup.java:25)\r\n\tat org.apache.derbyTesting.junit.BaseTestSetup.run(BaseTestSetup.java:57)\r\n\tat junit.extensions.TestDecorator.basicRun(TestDecorator.java:24)\r\n\tat junit.extensions.TestSetup$1.protect(TestSetup.java:21)\r\n\tat junit.extensions.TestSetup.run(TestSetup.java:25)\r\n\tat junit.extensions.TestDecorator.basicRun(TestDecorator.java:24)\r\n\tat junit.extensions.TestSetup$1.protect(TestSetup.java:21)\r\n\tat junit.extensions.TestSetup.run(TestSetup.java:25)\r\n\r\nFAILURES!!!\r\nTests run: 1,  Failures: 1,  Errors: 0\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
