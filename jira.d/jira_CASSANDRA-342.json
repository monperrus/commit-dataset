Hodges","active":true},"body":"This patch adds the ability for Cassandra databases to be read from in\r\na Hadoop setting. This is the \"stupid\" version of said support\r\n(c.f. \"not-stupid\" discussion\r\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-cassandra-dev/200907.mbox/%3Cf5f3a6290907240123y22f065edp1649f7c5c1add491@mail.gmail.com%3E\r\n).\r\n\r\nThis patch is only working when run in the non-distributed `./bin/hadoop\r\njar` environment of Hadoop.\r\n\r\n.h2 Building\r\n\r\nBuilding the patched Cassandra requires including\r\n`hadoop-0.20.0-core.jar` that is distributed with Hadoop 0.20.0\r\n(obviously) in Cassandra's `$CLASSPATH`. (Which is easiest to do by\r\nsimply copying the file to Cassandra's `lib` directory.)\r\n\r\nAn example of the adapter's use can be found in\r\n`src/examples/org/apache/cassandra/examples/WordCount.java`. You can\r\nrun `WordCount.java` with Hadoop by first editing the\r\n`conf/hadoop-env.sh` file and adding all of the jars in Cassandra's\r\nlib directory to `$HADOOP_CLASSPATH`. Building the examples is then\r\njust a matter of running `ant examples`.\r\n\r\n.h2 Running\r\n\r\nRunning the example is straightforward after that. Assuming you've\r\nadded some tweets to the Tweets column family with a column called\r\n`text` filled with, you know, text:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n./bin/hadoop jar \\\r\n  /path/to/cassandra/build/apache-cassandra-incubating-examples-0.4.0-dev.jar\\\r\n  org.apache.cassandra.examples.WordCount -inputspace Twitter \\\r\n  -inputfamily Tweets -outputdir outie \\\r\n  -confdir /path/to/cassandra/src/examples/conf/wordcount/\r\n{/code}\r\n\r\n.h2 Changes External to `cassandra.hadoop`\r\n\r\nThis patch makes two changes in the Cassandra project that are outside\r\nof the new `hadoop` package.\r\n\r\n # Makes `StorageProxy.getKeyRange()` public.\r\n \r\n # `RowSerializer` is now a public class and outside of Row. This was\r\n    done so I didn't have to rewrite the serialization code for\r\n    writing the `RowWritable` class.\r\n\r\n # Adds the `examples` ant task for building the jar file of cassandra\r\n   example code.\r\n\r\n.h2 Issues\r\n\r\nThis patch does have some issues. Specifically:\r\n\r\n # Has no tests.\r\n\r\n # Cannot split up the key ranges beyond what the entire key range\r\n   that exists on each individual node. This means we cannot delegate\r\n   to more Map tasks than there are Cassandra nodes. As we move to\r\n   billions of keys per node, this is even more of an\r\n   issue. (c.f. CASSANDRA-242)\r\n\r\n # Cassandra currently must be booted by this Hadoop-facing code in\r\n   order to work as a side effect of needing certain internal calls in\r\n   odd places and the onus put upon this project to keep everything\r\n   working internally. There is currently no way to hook into an\r\n   external Cassandra process.\r\n\r\n # Only has been tested and only works (due to the above boot code\r\n   issues) on one Cassandra node, with one Hadoop Map task.\r\n\r\n # Cannot take key ranges that cross over multiple nodes. This is\r\n   a problem with how we (can't) divvy up the keys instead of any other\r\n   problem (such as the ones described in CASSANDRA-348).\r\n\r\n # The current API for selecting what keys to grab cannot take\r\n   anything more than the table/keyspace to search in and the name of\r\n   a top-level super column.\r\n\r\n # Because of the lack of true \"multiget\" support, the reads from the\r\n   database have a round trip cost for each key desired.\r\n\r\n # The API is not well-fleshed out for grabbing data from a RowWritable.\r\n\r\n # Only provides read capability, no writing.\r\n\r\n # `KeyspaceRecordReader#getProgress()` is nothing more than a stub.\r\n\r\n # `RowWritable` does not implement `WritableComparable`, which would\r\n   allow its use as a key and not just a value in a MapReduce job. \r\n\r\n # `RowWritable` uses `RowSerializer` which encodes way too much\r\n   information about the column families and columns through\r\n   `ColumnFamilySerializer`.\r\n\r\n # Has a (likely inescapable) dependency on the hadoop 0.20\r\n   core jar.\r\n\r\n # Really, really has no tests.\r\n\r\nI could go into more detail about some of these issues, but this is\r\nalready too long and the discussion adds even more text.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jmhodges","name":"jmhodges","emailAddress":"jeff at somethingsimilar dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeff Hodges","active":true},"created":"2009-08-17T09:13:19.725+0000","updated":"2009-08-17T09:34:12.260+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432214/comment/12744002","id":"12744002","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jmhodges","name":"jmhodges","emailAddress":"jeff at somethingsimilar dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeff Hodges","active":true},"body":"I could also provide an unsquashed version of the commits that led to this patch, if needed.

For every new Task needed, a new JVM is booted up.[1]\r\n\r\nThis is actually okay, distributed-systems-wise, because it keeps all the Tasks from interfering with one another.\r\n\r\nIt does, however, make our jobs harder. There is no way for a Task (and thus this Hadoop code in these patches) to access the runtime of a Cassandra node already on the machine because they will be in separate JVMs!\r\n\r\nHBase, as I mentioned above, solves this problem by first starting up HBase on those remote machines, and then having each Task create an HTable object from the InputSplit handed to it. This HTable object connects to the local HBase process. (Of course, this same thing happens in the JVM that creates the InputSplits.)\r\n\r\nSo, here's my deal. There is no way for this currently designed system to work efficiently in a distributed system. This is because we have to boot a brand new Cassandra process on machines that might already have (and need if hardware is limited) one running already. The boot up time for Cassandra alone is a big time sink. And consider how these nodes would interoperate with the \"stable\", non-Hadoop nodes that would start sending them data. Ugh.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid all of this boot time drama if we can come up with a good way of remotely accessing all of the internal information we need from the Cassandra node already running. I have not been able to come up with an alternative solution.\r\n\r\nComments?\r\n\r\n[1] There is something called \"Task reuse\" that can be configured into a Hadoop deployment. However, the \"reuse\" only means that a Task can be used more than once for the same Job. So, it's basically just\r\nanother complicating factor in our boot loading code (one of the reasons there is BootUp.boot() and BootUp.bootUnsafe()) but doesn't help us with our problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jmhodges","name":"jmhodges","emailAddress":"jeff at somethingsimilar dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeff Hodges","active":true},"created":"2009-08-21T05:44:56.516+0000","updated":"2009-08-21T05:55:17.475+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432214/comment/12745974","id":"12745974","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"thanks, all of that makes sense now.\r\n\r\nI'm +1 on applying what Jeff has here as a first step and refining in another ticket.

We also get InputSplit location information for free.\r\n\r\nMy patch 01 and 02 correspond to Jeff's 02 and 03 (no changes to Cassandra internals have been required so far).
