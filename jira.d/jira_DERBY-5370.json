Committed to trunk at subversion revision 1160680.\r\n\r\nThe new test relies on a table function which extends org.apache.derby.vti.VTITemplate, an implementation of the JDBC 3.0 ResultSet. JDBC 3.0 ResultSets pull in classes which do not exist on the small JSR169 platform, resulting in ClassNotFoundExceptions during method resolution.\r\n\r\nKathey noticed that the new test case fails on weme. She posted her findings in this derby-dev thread: http://old.nabble.com/weme-failures-with-a-sane-build-to32316105.html#a32316105\r\n\r\nTouches the following file:\r\n\r\nM      java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/RestrictedVTITest.java\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2011-08-23T13:35:15.463+0000","updated":"2011-08-23T13:35:15.463+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12516930/comment/13089469","id":"13089469","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Ported 1160680 from trunk to 10.8 branch at subversion revision 1160683.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2011-08-23T13:38:42.502+0000","updated":"2011-08-23T13:38:42.502+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12516930/comment/13208907","id":"13208907","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Assigning this issue to Brett who contributed the patch.
