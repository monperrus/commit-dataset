The DERBY-1847 version of that code\r\nonly handled the case of adding a bit to the COLUMNS column; this patch\r\nextends that method to support removing a bit from the COLUMNS\r\ncolumn as well, then calls the method from the AlterTable execution logic.\r\n\r\nThe diff file is rather large because because it includes the removal of\r\naltertableDropColumn.sql and altertableDropColumn.out, and the\r\nmerging of those files into altertable.sql and altertable.out, so the\r\nentire contents of those files are included in the diff twice each :)\r\n\r\nThe rest of the diff is pretty small and straightforward and hopefully is\r\nnot hard to review.\r\n\r\nThe diff includes the proposed 2-line change from DERBY-1847, because\r\nthat change is mandatory for this fix. Once the DERBY-1847 change is\r\nresolved, I'll revisit this diff to remove those two lines from DataDictionaryImpl.java\r\n\r\nThe proposed patch has one particularly interesting behavior: in the case\r\nin which a column is dropped from a table, and there exists a user who\r\nwas granted privileges on that column, and that column only, in that table,\r\nthe diff processes their SYSCOLPERMS row and leaves a \"empty\" row; that\r\nis, a row in which the COLUMNS column of SYSCOLPERMS has all bits clear.\r\nFrom what I can tell, this does not cause any problems; the behavior is\r\nreasonable. However, it might be argued that it would be preferable to\r\nentirely delete the row in this case. Feedback from reviewers about this\r\nbehavior and about how to address it (if necessary), would be much appreciated.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-12-28T16:55:41.000+0000","updated":"2006-12-28T16:55:41.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12352140/comment/12462722","id":"12462722","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Attached is rewrite_syscolperms_v2.diff.
