Since the orExpression() rule only matches conjunctions of boolean primaries and valueExpression() matches disjunctions of orExpression(), this change makes it possible to both OR and AND expressions where only AND expressions could be used previously.\r\n\r\nThe patch changes the following production rules:\r\n\r\nderivedColumn(): This rule is used in select lists. The change allows statements like \"SELECT b1 OR b2 FROM t\".\r\n\r\nmethodParameter(): Used for parameters in function/procedure calls. Makes statements like \"VALUES booleanFunction(TRUE OR FALSE)\" work.\r\n\r\nupdateSource(): Used in UPDATE statements and allows statements like: \"UPDATE t SET b = TRUE OR FALSE\"\r\n\r\nrowValueConstructorElement(): Used in VALUES statements and allows statements like: VALUES TRUE OR FALSE\r\n\r\nwhenThenExpression(): This production rule actually worked before, because it had inlined valueExpression(). The patch changes it to call valueExpression() instead of duplicating the code. Added a test case for CASE WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE to verify that it still works.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, only the valueExpression() rule uses the orExpression() rule directly.
