However, the default methods don't behave quite like the test expect. There are three kinds of failures:\r\n\r\n- NullPointerException: These happen because we check if the SQLState starts with \"0A\". That is, whether or not it's an SQLFeatureNotSupportedException. However, the exceptions thrown by the default methods don't have an SQLState. It is null, and the check fails with NPE.\r\n\r\n- UnsupportedOperationException: The default methods for the mandatory JDBC 4.2 methods throw these rather than SQLFeatureNotSupportedException. The test is not prepared for this.\r\n\r\n- The default method for Statement.getLargeMaxRows() returns 0, also if the statement is closed. The test expects the method to throw an exception if the statement is closed.\r\n\r\nThe test should only test the methods that we actually implement, and we could skip those methods that lack an implementation.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch makes the test skip those methods that don't have an implementation in the Derby classes. It uses reflection and the isSynthetic() method to check this.\r\n\r\nI've verified that the patch skips the 252 previously failing test cases (and only those) when running with Java 8 on the 10.9 branch. The test also passes on trunk with the patch.\r\n\r\nThis fix should theoretically make the test work with no changes on later JDBC versions as well. We'll see how that plays out in practice when we get there...\r\n\r\nColour diff: https://github.com/kahatlen/derby/commit/b22ca3b4526222987ff134b7230f51ddd1940b18","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2013-04-04T08:39:14.534+0000","updated":"2013-04-04T08:39:14.534+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12640459/comment/13621949","id":"13621949","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed to trunk with revision 1464367.\r\nMerged to 10.10 and committed revision 1464372.\r\nMerged to 10.9 and committed revision 1464373.\r\n\r\nThe patch does not compile on 10.8, so I'll just disable the test for Java 8 and later on that branch.
