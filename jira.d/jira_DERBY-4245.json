reference the passed in stream to readExternal.\r\n    This is just wrong, and is what causes the NPE.\r\n - LimitInputStream does not support mark/reset.\r\n\r\nIn the case of LimitInputStream, the underlying BufferedInputStream supports mark/reset. In this cause we read 5 bytes, resets and skips two bytes. This causes the limit stream to believe it can only deliver 59998 bytes, whereas the correct number is 60003 (full length minus header length). The five bytes involved in the mark/reset are \"lost\".\r\n\r\nI'm not yet sure how to handle mark/reset with the limit reader.\r\nI plan to address the problems in SQLClob under this issue, and create a sub-issue for the limit stream.\r\n\r\nThe repro passes with the preview patch, and because mark/reset isn't used much it may also pass the regression tests (the fix for LimitInputStream is broken).\r\nI'm starting the regression tests now, will report back with the results.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2009-05-25T10:27:38.802+0000","updated":"2009-05-25T10:27:38.802+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426254/comment/12713297","id":"12713297","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"The regression tests passed, but that does *not* mean the patch is ready for commit :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2009-05-26T22:33:10.263+0000","updated":"2009-05-26T22:33:10.263+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426254/comment/12714806","id":"12714806","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"It doesn't look like the upgrade step is necessary in order to reproduce this issue.
