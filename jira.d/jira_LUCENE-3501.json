modules/facet/src/java/org/apache/lucene/facet/search/sampling/RepeatableSampler.java\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nI looked at this, and also discussed with Gilad, and it seems that:\r\n\r\n* The test is broken as it claims to do N trials in case of failure but it does not, because its try/catch does not catch AssertionError, and so only one trial is attempted. (Few trials make sense because with sampling, there is always a possibility that the selected sample set of docs would not contain the \"correct\" best facets even with a high over sampling ratio (over sampling means that for the selected set of docs more best facets are collected).\r\n\r\n* Even after fixing the test to actually try more than once, it still fails, because there is no randomness in RandomSample...  surprising but true.\r\n\r\nIn this patch:\r\n* Sampler made an abstract class.\r\n* RandomSample renamed to RepeatableSampler which extends Sampler.\r\n* RandomSampler was added - it too extends Sampler - this is a simple *random* implementation, which is now the default (used by default in SamplingWrapperAccumulator).\r\n* The test randomly selects between the two sampler implementations. If you want to see the behavior that created the bug, remove that latter randomness by setting to false the variable *useRandomSampler* of *BaseSampleTestTopK.testCountUsingSamping()*.\r\n\r\nI think this is ready to commit. \r\nWasn't sure though, where should the Changes entry go?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"created":"2011-10-09T15:40:26.442+0000","updated":"2011-10-09T15:50:58.206+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12526373/comment/13123717","id":"13123717","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"I briefly went through the patch:\r\n\r\n* In the test, I prefer to still catch Exception, or if you want to be on the safe side, Throwable.
