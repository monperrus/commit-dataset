Just put this thread name on the rogue list and we are fine. The badest thing is interrupting this thread for no reason. The PKCS thread is generated on MacOSX, because its underlying security system is different from Windows or Linux. On Windows and MacOSX the PKCS system uses the trusted root certificates from the operating system and it seems that on MacOSX this needs some thread to handle the OS' PKCS library. Its as stupid as killing processes on Android phones as recreating them uses more resources than keep them running. If you start to kill this thread you can also kill all GC threads just for fun :-)\r\n\r\nThe reason why serialization starts the thread: Serialization uses hashing, too :-) - The PKCS thread is for me just a system thread with the difference that its started lazily when first accessed.\r\n\r\nOne thing: I don't like the empty catch blocks /* cannot happen */. Even if this is the case, please throw at least a RuntimException. Some user may stiull use a broken JVM where the charsets.jar file is lost :-) (ok, that should not happen, but I like it more to have that).\r\n\r\n+1 for the UTF-8 fix (this will not break most lock file names, as filenames and hopefully index dir pathes are mostly ASCII)\r\n-1 for MD5Digest code duplication\r\n-1 for the temp file code dumplication\r\n\r\nMy opinion:\r\nLazy init the static MessageDigest class in FSDirectory. Its almost never used.\r\n\r\nWill post an alternative patch soon (lazy init MessageDigest only when needed first, add fixed UTF-8 charset).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2010-12-27T09:55:55.738+0000","updated":"2010-12-27T09:55:55.738+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12494097/comment/12975227","id":"12975227","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Here my patch.

Sure it's code\r\ndup but it's tiny and it mitigates risk so I think it's well worth\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn general Lucene should not use \"interesting\" (risky) parts of the\r\nJVM/Java if we can avoid it w/o much cost, and this is a really silly\r\nreason to be using MessageDigest (similar to our now-gone crazy usage\r\nof ManagementFactory just to acquire a test lock).  We are a search\r\nlibrary!  We must use the bare minimum of the OS/filesystem/JVM that\r\nwe need.\r\n\r\nIn fact in this case... can't we nuke DIGESTER altogether?  Lucene now\r\nstores lock files in the index dir by default as \"write.lock\".  We\r\nonly need this digest if you change that dir.  So, if your app somehow\r\nwants to put the lock file elsewhere (unusual), it should be up to you\r\nto name it \"uniquely\" relative to other IWs storing locks in the same\r\ndir (we can do this under a separate issue).\r\n\r\nAnd not using SecureRandom to create temp files is a no-brainer -- the\r\nbuiltin File.createTempFile must be secure, by design, but we\r\nobviously don't need that here. I've had awful problems in the past w/\r\nSecureRandom (because my machine didn't have enough true\r\nrandomness!).  Again: Lucene should only use what's we really need.\r\n\r\nI think we can remove the controversial \"interrupt the weird OS X\r\nPKCS11 thread\" from the patch since serialization is now gone?
