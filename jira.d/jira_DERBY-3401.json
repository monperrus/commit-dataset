That way, (add/remove)ConnectionEventListener knows if the list is currently being iterated over. If it is being iterated over, the list is cloned and the add/remove operation is performed on the clone. That way, the iterator is not affected and continues to work just as if no listener has been added or removed.\r\n\r\nThe logic is somewhat more complex than the code for the statement event listeners, as we don't have CopyOnWriteArrayList available in Java 1.4. However, it is less costly, as it only copies the list in the cases where modifying the list directly would have caused problems (CopyOnWriteArrayList always copies the list when it's
