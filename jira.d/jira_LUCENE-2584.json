I see the code is no longer problematic in the trunk (and others ported from flex_1458), looks it was fixed while implementing post 3.x features. The fix to 3.x and 2.9.x branches could be the same - create the files set first and populate it, and then assign to the member variable at the end of the method. This will resolve the issue.

One note, I noticed (in flex_1458/trunk) that you are using the HashSet to collect the file names and then convert it to ArrayList; while this is a good idea to  guarantee the uniqueness of the file names, it also could mask any code that accidentally adds the same file more than once (something that I would prefer to notice rather than mask). So I used an assertion to ensure both the uniqueness of the names and correctness of the code that adds names. Also, with assertions disabled, this approach adds no additional performance overhead at all. But if you'd like to use the HashSet to collect the file names, let me know so I will redo the patches.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kanarsky","name":"kanarsky","emailAddress":"alexander dot kanarsky at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10441","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10441","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10441","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10441"},"displayName":"Alexander Kanarsky","active":true},"created":"2010-08-04T20:23:31.676+0000","updated":"2010-08-04T20:23:31.676+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470693/comment/12983142","id":"12983142","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"On one hand, it's good to add the files to a Set, so that we can be sure they are added uniquely.
