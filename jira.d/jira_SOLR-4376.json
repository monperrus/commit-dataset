}\r\n{code} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - When LAST_INDEX_TIME is found in the data-import.properties, the value in the map is a String.\r\n - When LAST_INDEX_TIME is not found, we use timestamp = 0, but the value is a Date\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - When using full-import it works fine because basically we don't need this LAST_INDEX_TIME. \r\n - When doing delta import after a full import it also works fine.\r\n - But when doing a first delta import on a clean configuration, without any data-import.properties present, I have an SQL exception because of this query:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT xxx \r\nFROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION yyy \r\nWHERE last_updated > 'Thu Jan 01 01:00:00 CET 1970'\r\n{code} \r\n\r\nWhile normally the query is:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT xxx \r\nFROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION yyy \r\nWHERE last_updated > '1970-01-01 01:00:00'\r\n{code} \r\n\r\nFor a configured query being:\r\n{code:sql}\r\ndeltaQuery=\"SELECT bje.job_execution_id as JOB_EXECUTION_ID\r\nFROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION bje\r\nWHERE last_updated > '${dih.last_index_time}'\"\r\n{code} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think in any case, the value associated to the key in the map must be consistent and either be String or Date, but not both. \r\n\r\nPersonally I would expect it to be stored as String, and the EPOCH date being formatted in the exact same format the date properties are persisted in the file, which is:\r\norg.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SimplePropertiesWriter#dateFormat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis doesn't have a real impact on our code but it is just that an integration test \"test_delta_import_when_never_indexed\" was unexpectedly failing while all others were ok, after a Solr 1.4 to Solr 4.1 migration. \r\nThus it seems to be a minor regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"310580","summary":"dih.last_index_time
