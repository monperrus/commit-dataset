Committed revision 1431948.\r\n\r\nI have no reason to believe there are other ordering bugs, so I don't think we need to change it to run with fixed execution order now. However, I added some code to the tearDown() method to print the names of all tables, procedures and function that live in the APP schema after each test case has completed, and found that testDuplicates() leaves a procedure called PROCDUP and testDynamicResultSets() leaves one called INSERTCAUSINGROLLBACK. If other test cases depend on the existence of those procedures, ordering may affect the result. I don't know if there are such dependencies, but I think we should make the two test cases clean up after themselves in any case. I'll post a follow-up patch.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2013-01-11T09:32:50.350+0000","updated":"2013-01-11T09:32:50.350+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626931/comment/13551019","id":"13551019","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"There was also a schema WAY created by testDynamicResultSets() and not dropped.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch (d6039-2a.diff) makes the test cases drop all procedures, functions and schemas they have created.\r\n\r\nCommitted revision 1431961.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2013-01-11T09:54:50.004+0000","updated":"2013-01-11T09:54:50.004+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626931/comment/13553334","id":"13553334","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
