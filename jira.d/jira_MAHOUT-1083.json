This is another example of the Hadoop platform reusing a single instance of the Writable every time another one is read from the input stream. Every time iter.next() is called, the same object (cw == first) will be returned. This does not show up in unit tests because only a single reducer is ever used. It explains exactly the odd clustering behavior you have observed.\r\n\r\nHere's a patch that *may* fix the problem.
