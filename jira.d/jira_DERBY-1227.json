cause the wrong statement to be returned and so could be potentially serious and hard to diagnose in the field.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM:\r\nI think there are reflection calls for prepared statements for methods that are not avable in BrokeredPreparedStatements: e.g. \r\n\r\nMethod sh =\r\n\t\t\t\tgetPreparedStatement().getClass().getMethod(\"getEmbedParameterSetMetaData\", getParameterMetaDataParam);\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIX:\r\nOne possible fix might be to implement an org.apache.derby.iapi.jdbc.EnginePreparedStatement interface similar to EngineConnection that will allow exposure of these methods and allow  consistant  interaction between EmbedPreparedStatements and BrokeredPreparedStatements.\r\nSee  org.apache.derby.iapi.jdbc.EngineConnection for a more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot
