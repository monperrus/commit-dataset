You can delete the commit points on disk, but the one in\r\nmemory is private to IndexWriter and moves forward as segments are\r\nflushed, merged, etc.  When IndexWriter commits, it makes a new\r\non-disk commit point that's a copy of the in-memory one.\r\n\r\nThis bug is happening because when IndexWriter commits (during close),\r\nit thinks there are no pending changes and so does nothing.  But,\r\nthere was a change (you removed the last commit point), and so I think\r\nwe should mark doing so as a real change.  What this will mean is\r\nIndexWriter will simply write the next segments_N file which is a copy\r\nof the one you had just deleted.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot
