This means that if maxDocCharsToAnalyse is set to exactly the length of the text and the last token of the text is the term to highlight and is followed by non-token text, this non-token text will not be highlighted.\n\nFor example, consider the phrase \"this is a text with searchterm in it\". \"In\" and \"it\" are not tokenized because they're stopwords. Setting maxDocCharsToAnalyze to 36 (the length of the sentence) and searching for \"searchterm\" gives a fragment ending in \"searchterm\". The expected behaviour is to have \"in it\" at the end of the fragment, since maxDocCharsToAnalyse explicitely states that the whole phrase should be considered.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10120","value":"Patch Available","id":"10120"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"26725","summary":"Highlight fragment does not extend to maxDocCharsToAnalyze","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=larsko","name":"larsko","emailAddress":"lars at larsko dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Kotthoff","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=larsko","name":"larsko","emailAddress":"lars at larsko dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Kotthoff","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":2,"total":2,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399256/comment/12609161","id":"12609161","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=larsko","name":"larsko","emailAddress":"lars at larsko dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Kotthoff","active":true},"body":"Patch changing \"text.length()< maxDocCharsToAnalyze\" to \"text.length()<= maxDocCharsToAnalyze\" and adding a unit test to verify this behaviour.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=larsko","name":"larsko","emailAddress":"lars at larsko dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Kotthoff","active":true},"created":"2008-06-30T06:23:16.929+0000","updated":"2008-06-30T06:23:16.929+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399256/comment/12609220","id":"12609220","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"Thanks Lars.
