This has the very negative effect of setting a maximum time that compaction can take before a manual repair will fail.\r\n\r\nFor automatic/natural repairs (triggered by two nodes autonomously finishing major compactions around the same time), you want a relatively low TREE_STORE_TIMEOUT value, because trees generated a long time apart will cause a lot of unnecessary repair. The current value is 10 minutes, to optimize for this case.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for manual repairs, TREE_STORE_TIMEOUT needs to be significantly higher. For instance, if a manual repair is triggered for a source node A storing 2 TB of data, and a destination node B with an empty store, then node B needs to wait long enough for node A to finish compacting 2 TB of data, which might take > 12 hours. If a node B times out the local tree before node A sends its tree, then the repair will not occur.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12448001","id":"12448001","filename":"0001-Remove-natural-repair-throttling-in-preparation-for-.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","emailAddress":"stuhood
