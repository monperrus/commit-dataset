This means for example, if you are trying to listen to readers in NRT search you are just accumulating reader listeners, all potentially keeping references to old indexreaders (because, in order to deal with #1 your listener must 'keep' a reference to the IR it was registered on, so it can check if thats *really* the one).\r\n\r\nWe should discuss how to fix #1. \r\n\r\nI will create a patch for #2 shortly and commit it, its just plain wrong.\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"24372","summary":"problems with IR's readerFinishedListener","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":15,"total":15,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12534948/comment/13168351","id":"13168351","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Hi,\r\n\r\n+1, I was f*cking with this the whole day when rewriting oirectoryReader/MultiReader.\r\n\r\nThe bad thing is also that the Set(CHM) is not initialized in IndexReader base class (and is not final), the subclasses must do it.

Its perfectly fine to have listeners in this case. If you are implementing a cache based on core readers (think custom filter cache for example), its basically the only sane way to do it (and not have to handle weak references which is bad on GC and error prone with complex keys). And Lucene should allow for that.\r\n\r\nI don't think the separation to segment core listener and index reader listener is the best solution here, since it exposes \"too much info\" to the user (having to deal with different reader cases, check FieldCacheImpl for example). I don't really mind it, since in my case I only work on low level Segment case (which is the sane way to work when you do NRT) and can handle it, but not sure its best in a general usability wise case.
