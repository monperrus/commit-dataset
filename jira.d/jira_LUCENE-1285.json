The end result for this particular term will depend on the order in which the clauses are processed.\n\nMy fix is to use a subclass of Map, which on put() always sets the result to the most lax setting, i.e. if we already have a term with positionSensitive=true, and we try to put() a term with positionSensitive=false, we set the result positionSensitive=false, as it will match both
