Sure maybe its annoying that things like ngrams violate all these rules and will fail if term vectors are on, but these are broken analyzers that need to be fixed and we shouldn't allow bogus data in the index.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the current situation (besides checkindex), is if someone has such bogus offsets in an older index\r\nand they try to use something like Highlighter they will just trip errors from OffsetAttribute, etc. So they won't really work.\r\n\r\nBest idea i have so far:\r\n# Fix LUCENE-4180 so that we can differentiate between 4.0-alpha and 4.0-beta indexes\r\n# Change default term vectors merge impl to buffer one doc in RAM, if it has invalid offsets, clear the offsets bit and dont write them.\r\n# Only enable bulk merge for 4.x codec, when the segment was written by 4.0-beta+, otherwise just call super.merge\r\n\r\nOne downside is that we must keep the one-doc buffering (part 2) even in trunk until 6.x to support 4.0-alpha indexes, but its too late now.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot
