I'll do another pass and improve the error handling.\r\nOff the top of my head, maybe the following:\r\n o method sleep: ignore interrupt, allow premature wakeup, leave interrupted status cleared\r\n o javaProcess.waitFor: throw exception, leave interrupted status cleared\r\n o xSaver.join: not sure about this one. Would it be best to retry, or simply continue (as with current patch)?\r\n\r\nAs you say, I don't think the test framework will interrupt the thread in the normal case. The reason for not restoring the interrupted flag in the cases were we don't handle it must be that it can cause other code to fall over, i.e. IO calls in another unrelated test. The caller probably can't do anything to recover from the interrupts, so it would maybe be better to swallow them after all (except for in the javaProcess.waitFor case).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2011-10-05T20:06:23.947+0000","updated":"2011-10-05T20:06:23.947+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525656/comment/13121426","id":"13121426","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Patch 1b changes how InterruptedExceptions are handled; they are now either ignored (because it doesn't matter for SpawnedProcess), or an exception is raised.\r\n\r\nRunning regressions now.\r\nPatch ready for review.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2011-10-05T20:13:18.882+0000","updated":"2011-10-05T20:13:18.882+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525656/comment/13121622","id":"13121622","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.

I think, if we don't expect any interrupts to happen that it's good to just fail the test, since probably it would be assign that something else is wrong - better to fail early. I see now you ignore it in two cases: sleep (where it doesn't really matter as you say) and while waiting for the two streamsavers to terminate. You throw in the case where we get interrupted before we are able to see the spawned process terminate and get its error code. I guess that protects the main functionality, but I think I'd prefer throwing in the other two cases as well (from the fail early principle). Unless you can see a reason it would be good to continue here?
