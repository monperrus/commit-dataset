This isn't a bug: if you delete the last character, its all that must happen.\r\n\r\nYou're right. So first, this isn't what happens. If pos=3 and len=4 (delete the last character), it calls System.arraycopy (even in the patch I posted). This could be improved. Second, the problem is that it deletes the last character, even if pos >= length. I.e. you ask to delete the character beyond what is \"valid\" in that buffer.
