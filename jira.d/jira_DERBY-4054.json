It doesn't wait for the timeout.\r\nThis exception causes us to leave reclaimSpace and somehow this exception gets gobbled up somewhere  and never reported, so the space does not get reclaimed and we don't get a report of a problem  I haven't quite figured out where we decide to ignore the exception and move on.  If I run in the debugger the exception just get's thrown and not ignored for some reason.\r\n\r\nIf I hack in the change:\r\nContainerHandle containerHdl = null;\r\n       try {\r\n            containerHdl = \r\n\t\t\topenContainerNW(tran, container_rlock, work.getContainerId());\r\n        } catch (StandardException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n            if (e.getSQLState().equals(\"40XL1\"))\r\n                containerHdl = null;            \r\n        }\r\n\r\nThen I will proceed and will hit the message \"  gave up after 3 tries to get container lock \" described in DERBY-4055.\r\n\r\nBased on this finding I think I am going to rearrange the Jira issues a little bit. I am going to make DERBY-4055 just be for the row lock case and keep this one for the table lock case.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot
