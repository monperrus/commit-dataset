The fix was committed earlier (for Solr 4.3), and I left this open to (eventually, heh) address your feedback after the commit.  I just committed an enhancement that shows all possible collation queries, along with their hit count; note that the counts are within the currently selected filters not globally.  Regarding the debugging, I recommend simply adding &wt=xml (or clicking the link in the footer) to get at the raw response suitable for developer-level debugging.  I also often simply put into the template $response... and $object.class kind of expressions directly into the template and refresh my browser to see gory details that help craft the templates.
