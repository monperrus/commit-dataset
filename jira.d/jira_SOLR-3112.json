It seems to copy the core/src/test-files/solr/conf/elevate.xml to same path but different filename (elevate-data-distrib.xml) right before testing. Then the test uses the new file and doesn't clean it at the end. Well, I wonder why the test makes that copy. Maybe I didn't get something, but rather than cleaning at the end, my patch removes that copy and the test seems to work anyway.
