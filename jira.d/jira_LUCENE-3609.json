Here is the logic that was before:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nif (shouldFilters != null) {\r\n      for (int i = 0; i < shouldFilters.size(); i++) {\r\n        if (res == null) {\r\n          res = new OpenBitSetDISI(getDISI(shouldFilters, i, reader), reader.maxDoc());\r\n        } else { \r\n          DocIdSet dis = shouldFilters.get(i).getDocIdSet(reader);\r\n          if(dis instanceof OpenBitSet) {\r\n            // optimized case for OpenBitSets\r\n            res.or((OpenBitSet) dis);\r\n          } else {\r\n            res.inPlaceOr(getDISI(shouldFilters, i, reader));\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n    \r\nAssuming the getDISI returns EMTY iterator for a filter that does not match (and not null, as it will fail) for a single should clause, then the result of this will be a \"res\" all \"zeroed\" out (the first check on res==null). Then, if it went ahead and executed a must clause, it would and on a \"zeroed\" out bitset and the result is no matches.\r\n\r\nNow, with the change, we have this code:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nfor (final FilterClause fc : clauses) {\r\n  if (fc.getOccur() == Occur.SHOULD) {\r\n    final DocIdSetIterator disi = getDISI(fc.getFilter(), reader);\r\n    if (disi == null) continue;\r\n    if (res == null) {\r\n      res = new FixedBitSet(reader.maxDoc());\r\n    }\r\n    res.or(disi);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe result of a single should clause that does not match anything is a res still set to null, and then, when it gets to the must clause, it will or it with the result of the must clause, and return the docs that match the must clause. You can see this is different compared to the previous behavior and actually, different than the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n[Update]: And the fix should be to return null only if res is null and should clauses count is higher than 0 after the check for should clause count.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimchy","name":"kimchy","emailAddress":"kimchy at mac dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shay Banon","active":true},"created":"2011-11-29T20:20:35.902+0000","updated":"2011-11-29T20:22:53.848+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12533176/comment/13159524","id":"13159524","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"I agree there is something wrong.
