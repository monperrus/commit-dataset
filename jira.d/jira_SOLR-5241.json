So finally we can use any numeric IP, just no host name.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-09-14T09:08:18.339+0000","updated":"2013-09-14T09:08:18.339+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12668529/comment/13767484","id":"13767484","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"body":"Thanks Uwe.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"created":"2013-09-14T13:31:14.147+0000","updated":"2013-09-14T13:31:14.147+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12668529/comment/13768474","id":"13768474","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"body":"Commit 1523725 from hossman@apache.org in branch 'dev/trunk'\r\n[ https://svn.apache.org/r1523725 ]\r\n\r\nSOLR-5241: Fix SimplePostToolTest performance problem -
