Getting this information out of JVMInfo sounds like a good idea to me. The logic which compares strings in the DatabaseMetaData implementations might be a little brittle. I would suggest adding a couple more static methods to JVMInfo. These methods could be called by the DatabaseMetaData implementations:\r\n\r\npublic static int jdbcMajorVersion() { return 4; }\r\n\r\npublic static int jdbcMinorVersion()\r\n{\r\n    switch ( JDK_ID )\r\n    {\r\n    case J2SE_16: return 0;\r\n    case J2SE_17: return 1;\r\n    case J2SE_18:\r\n    default:\r\n        return 2;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nFor extra credit, these methods could be used to construct the version strings in JVMInfo.derbyVMLevel(). That way the JDBC level would still be maintained in only one place.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Rick\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2013-08-30T13:25:25.251+0000","updated":"2013-08-30T13:25:25.251+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12666118/comment/13756767","id":"13756767","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"Thanks for the review Rick.
