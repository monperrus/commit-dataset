If\r\ntheResults.isClosed() returns true and the isClosed field is false, it\r\nsets isClosed to true and calls closeCurrentStream() (similar to what\r\ncheckExecIfClosed() does if it detects that the connection is closed).\r\n\r\nI have also added a test case in jdbc4/ResultSetTest. This test case\r\nverifies that ResultSet.isClosed() returns true on non-holdable\r\nResultSets after commit. Without the patch, it failed on embedded and\r\npassed on the client. With the patch, it passes on both.\r\n\r\nI needed to make the following changes to existing tests:\r\n\r\n- jdbcapi/J2EEDataSourceTest - one SQL state changed in embedded\r\n  (Connection closed -> ResultSet closed). The client already expected\r\n  this SQL state, so now the test didn't have to check which driver it\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n- lang/nestedCommit.sql - one of the test cases evaluated a function\r\n  which committed the transaction. The returned result set was not\r\n  holdable, and was therefore closed by the commit. Before the patch,\r\n  ij would be able to read the first row before it failed when it\r\n  called next() a second time, whereas now it fails when it tries to\r\n  read a column in the first row.
