ByteBuffer internally checks limit() in all cases, so you cannot read beyond the limit. So when we create a slicer, the last buffer could be created not by a simple duplicate(), but instead by ByteBuffer.slice() [which is also a duplicate, but with other start [in our case still 0], but with a limited length (the modulo of (startOffset + length) % bufsize). As ByteBuffer is doing the checks in all cases, a duplicate buffer with a shorter length makes reading behind EOF impossible. The checks are done in all cases, by explicitely giving a limit for the last buffer we can correctly support EOF with IndexOutofBoundsException.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-09-05T22:22:24.000+0000","updated":"2012-09-05T22:22:24.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12606295/comment/13449206","id":"13449206","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"Uwe: this is how the whole patch works already.

Very simple! In my opinion, we should maybe check, if we can remove the whole Slicer in all Indexinputs? Just make the slice(...) method return the current BufferedIndexInput-based one. This could be another issue, once this is in.\r\n\r\nAbout the patch:\r\n- With the IndexInputSlicer which has a private \"mastercopy\" of the originalIndexInput, the openFullSlice method is garanteed to have 0L as file pointer. We should maybe assert this (because this is important, as in contrast to MMapIndexInput.slice(), clone() returns a clone with the same filepointer as the original). So add a assert 0L == cloned.getFilePointer().\r\n- I think we could minimize the code duplication in clone() and slice(). Just use slice() as only implementation and let clone() look like this (not tested): \r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\npublic MMapIndexInput clone() {\r\n  final MMapIndexInput clone = this.slice(this.description, 0L, this.length);\r\n  try {\r\n    clone.seek(this.getFilePointer());\r\n  } catch (IOException ioe) {\r\n    throw new RuntimException(\"Cannot happen...\");\r\n  }\r\n  return clone;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nBy that the code is not duplicated. The only downside is that it seeks two times on clone, but that should not be a problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-09-06T05:10:12.815+0000","updated":"2012-09-06T05:10:12.815+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12606295/comment/13449428","id":"13449428","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"Uwe: seems like good ideas i think.
