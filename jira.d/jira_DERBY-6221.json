This means that the access path result set has only two columns, not four. That is 1) the username from the index and 2) the rowPosition\r\n\r\nThe setting of referencedCols happens in FromBaseTable#changeAccessPath ca line 3163 in this line:\r\n\r\n    referencedCols = resultColumns.getReferencedFormatableBitSet(cursorTargetTable, false, false);\r\n\r\nThe logic in getReferencedFormatableBitSet has this code at the end:\r\n\r\n    if (colsAdded != index || always) {\r\n        return newReferencedCols;\r\n    } else {\r\n            return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn this case, colsAdded and index are both 2, and always == false, so null gets returned. Therefore the test in #generate concludes we have asked for all the columns (including password), which is not the case.\r\n\r\nWe could let FromBaseTable#changeAccessPath ask for always returning a bit set for referenced columns, as\r\n\r\n    referencedCols = resultColumns.getReferencedFormatableBitSet(cursorTargetTable, true, false);\r\n\r\nbut this is dangerous too, for now the test used to detect a reference to the password columns breaks since it believes there are four columns in the result.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should perform this test prior to modifying the access path.\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
