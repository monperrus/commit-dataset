Perhaps this system property should be mentioned somewhere in the derby tuning manual.\r\n\r\nFor completenesss, if someone is still interested on details:\r\n\r\nThe SQL query of interest is this one:\r\n\r\nSELECT c.* FROM AttrOcc c WHERE  EXISTS (SELECT 'X' FROM Occ p WHERE c.OccID=p.ID AND p.DISCRIMINATOR=1)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are two tables involved: A table Occ and a table Attrocc whereas the latter has a foreign key \r\nconstraint on column OccID that refers to the primary key column ID of table Occ:\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE Occ (\r\n  ID CHAR(15) PRIMARY KEY,\r\n  DISCRIMINATOR NUMERIC(10),\r\n  ...\r\n)\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE AttrOcc (\r\n  ID CHAR(15) PRIMARY KEY,\r\n  OCCID CHAR(15) NOT NULL REFERENCES OCC ON DELETE CASCADE,\r\n  ...\r\n)\r\n\r\nThere is no index on column Occ.DISCRIMINATOR.\r\n\r\nTable Occ has 267661 rows and table AttrOcc has 153084 rows.\r\n\r\nMy testprogram runs with -Xmx128m.\r\n\r\nIf I use default derby.language.maxMemoryPerTable (i.e.) 1024K, then the SQL statement above leads to that OutOfMemoryError. \r\nAnd the query take 192s for execution.\r\n\r\nIf I create a compound index on Occ(ID,DISCRIMINATOR) and use default derby.language.maxMemoryPerTable (i.e.) 1024K, then\r\nit needs a bit less memory, so that it runs with -Xmx128. And it takes 140s to execute. So this is slighly better.\r\n\r\nIf I set derby.language.maxMemoryPerTable to 0 (and without index on Occ(ID,DISCRIMINATOR)), then memory consumption is\r\nminimal: -Xmx48 is sufficient. And it takes only 19s to execute (This is an order of magnitude better than the \r\nderby.language.maxMemoryPerTable=1024 variant).\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gekhin","name":"gekhin","emailAddress":"g dot khin at ids-scheer dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gerald Khin","active":true},"created":"2004-12-20T07:56:22.000+0000","updated":"2004-12-20T07:56:22.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/29057/comment/61391","id":"61391","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jackklebanoff","name":"jackklebanoff","emailAddress":"klebanoff-derby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jack Klebanoff","active":true},"body":"Subversion revision 157861","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jackklebanoff","name":"jackklebanoff","emailAddress":"klebanoff-derby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jack Klebanoff","active":true},"created":"2005-03-23T06:58:30.000+0000","updated":"2005-03-23T06:58:30.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/29057/comment/12420368","id":"12420368","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Assigning to SQL component.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2006-07-12T00:05:35.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-12T00:05:35.000+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-106/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i07b6n:"}}
