CoveredIdxScan. The helper method uses the getConnection() method to obtain the connection, so now the calls to getConnection().commit() commit on the correct connection. Using the helper method also removes the need to close the statement explicitly in tearDown(). Also, getConnection().commit() was simplified to commit() (helper in BaseJDBCTestCase) which does the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe patch doesn't appear change the results of the tests in any noticeable way. This is as expected, since there shouldn't be much work required on commit for read-only transactions with read committed isolation level (no log records to flush, and all locks should have been released prior to commit).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-04-06T18:10:52.965+0000","updated":"2010-04-06T18:10:52.965+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461225/comment/12854101","id":"12854101","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 931255.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-04-06T18:18:16.189+0000","updated":"2010-04-06T18:18:16.189+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-4607/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06w1b:"}}
