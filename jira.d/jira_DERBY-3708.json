One thing I notice is if I abort the test and the server process is left running I can then ping or shutdown the server.  So that lends itself to it being a problem with processing the output from the process (DERBY-3504).  It doesn't look like a clean merge though. I think I also need some other intervening change.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2008-06-23T18:21:45.423+0000","updated":"2008-06-23T18:21:45.423+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12397500/comment/12608131","id":"12608131","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"I think for the 10.3 fix I will backport the code change but not the test change and just test manually.
