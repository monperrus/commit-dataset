So these tests were removed in TestAssertions.\r\n-- note: should not remove these tests when merging to 3x.\r\n\r\n- TestSegmentMerger also failed with this fix - because it used the stale IW's SegmentInfos to create a compound segment.

Is there an easy way to disable this \"assertions enabled\" test?\r\n\r\nYou can also enable assertions just for the class/package which checks if assertions are enabled, Yonik. This should make the check pass and disable all other assertions (for benchmarking). I don't remember the syntax off the top of my head though.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nYonik, is this sufficient for running the perf tests? \r\nOtherwise I can add a -D flag for disabling testing this in LTC.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"created":"2011-10-27T06:29:23.485+0000","updated":"2011-10-27T06:29:23.485+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12526652/comment/13136915","id":"13136915","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"body":"For easier perf testing I added a -D flag to tell LTC not to fail each and every test if Java assertions are not enabled:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n-Dtests.asserts.gracious=true\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n(Tests requiring Java assertions - e.g. TestAssertions - will still fail, on purpose.)\r\n\r\n- r1189655 - trunk\r\n- r1189663 - 3x","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"created":"2011-10-27T08:48:29.932+0000","updated":"2011-10-27T08:48:29.932+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12526652/comment/13136953","id":"13136953","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"Thanks Doron, that works!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"created":"2011-10-27T10:37:27.837+0000","updated":"2011-10-27T10:37:27.837+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-3506/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04k0v:"}}
