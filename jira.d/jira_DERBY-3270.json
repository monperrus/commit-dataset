The column reference\r\n(A; expanded from *) is attempted bound against the table MYTABLE\r\ntwice inside FromBaseTable#getMatchingColumn: \r\n\r\nFirst, when the view is created. At this time the current compilation\r\nschema is JOE and there is no problem.\r\n\r\nSecond, the SELECT is bound, the view is expanded to a subquery (under\r\nDMLStatementNode#bind's call to bindTables->bindNonVTITables, parsed\r\nand table reference bound using the original schema, see comment in\r\nthat method), and then later the expressions are bound under\r\nDMLStatementNode#bind's call to bindExpressions. This time the\r\ncompilation schema is reset to BILL, however. \r\nIn FromBaseTable#getMatchingColumn, the call:\r\n\r\n  columnsTableName.bind(this.getDataDictionary());\r\n\r\ntries to bind the unqualified table name (MYTABLE) and finds the current schema\r\nBILL. If BILL already exists, this goes well, if not, we see\r\nDERBY-3270. Now, if this is bound incorrectly, why does it work? It\r\nseems this binding is inconsequential, in that columnsTableName is a\r\nlocal variable, and if we follow the logic in getMatchingColumn after\r\nthe binding, we see that the matching happens with this call:\r\n\r\n  if (columnsTableName == null || columnsTableName.equals(exposedTableName))\r\n  {\r\n     resultColumn = resultColumns.getResultColumn(columnReference.getColumnName());\r\n\r\nexposedTableName has the same (wrong) binding, derived from\r\nFromTable#origTableName, so the equals test works. Next, we basically\r\njust checks if \"A\" is present in resultColumns. resultColumns is\r\ncorrect since the table was bound correctly already.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what the right fix is here, though. It would appear that\r\nbinding schema incorrectly as done in getMatchingColumn (and for origTableName) \r\nis not good, and the first patch doesn't address that. \r\n\r\nMaybe we could note the original compilation schema in the root of the view subquery\r\nsubsituted from the view name in the original query and find that\r\n(walking up the tree) when the current default schema is looked up\r\nsomehow?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagw","name":"dagw","emailAddress":"dag dot wanvik at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagw&avatarId=16789"},"displayName":"Dag H.
