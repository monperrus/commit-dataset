The latter always generates an EmbedSQLException, and comments in EmbedSQLException and StandardException indicate that it's just a hack for Cloudscape 3.0.1 that was supposed to be cleaned up later.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot
