I would like to link this issue as it relates to Stu Hood's previous comments that bytes will be returned as encoded UTF-8 bytes, with the client not caring what data is encoded within those bytes.  \r\n\r\nWe're tried to do this specifically with Lucandra and numeric range queries.  Unfortunately there appears to be a bug in the thrift system.  I've created a test case which demonstrates this bug here.  It's marked for getting fixed in 6.4, but I want to make sure it's linked to this issue given that it will block clients such as my own from using bytes and could potentially cause problems with migrating to this system in 0.7","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tnine","name":"tnine","emailAddress":"todd dot nine at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tnine&avatarId=22405","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tnine&avatarId=22405","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tnine&avatarId=22405","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tnine&avatarId=22405"},"displayName":"Todd Nine","active":true},"created":"2010-07-11T03:27:48.881+0000","updated":"2010-07-11T03:27:48.881+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12455396/comment/12894370","id":"12894370","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"About Lucandra: Currently all keys in Lucene are valid UTF-8 encoded bytes, so making them Strings in Cassandra is fine - also for numeric terms as Todd Nine said (they use only 7 bits of the byte[], so are valid UTF-8 - but there was still a bug in Cassandra by trimming keys, now solved).\r\n\r\nLucene trunk now has migrated to pure byte[] terms, so Lucandra will do the same.
