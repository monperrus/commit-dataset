When derbyStress ran in derbyall it ran with 64MB heap so that it could test fixes for various memory leaks.  When moved to JDBCHarnessJavaTest it started running with the full 512MB heap used for suites.All so no longer tests for those leaks.  There are two options presented so far\n1) Move it back to derbyall \n2) add it to the junit-all target \nFor the adding it to the junit-all target option I think a few things have to happen for it to be run as part of the nightlies.\n    1) Convert derbyStress.java to junit.\n    2) create a junit-lomem target and make it part of junit-all.\n    3) Fix junit-all so that it can run with the nightlies. DERBY-2045 + distribute ant to the testing machines make nightly script changes etc.\n\nMyrna expressed some misgivings to relying on junit-all because ant is not available on all the platforms where she tests. I think the best course of action is to at least temporarily move the test back to derbyall and then open separate task(s) for the junit conversion effort.\n\n\n\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12310200":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"39607","summary":"jdbcapi/derbyStress.java no longer runs with low memory heap so does not provide testing for leak scenarios ","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310090":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12310050":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":2,"total":2,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12386646/comment/12560557","id":"12560557","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Dan said it is ok to move back to derbyall temporily in DERBY-3336.
