All tests pass.  I plan to commit in a day or two.\r\n\r\nHere are the changes:\r\n\r\n  * No longer throw an exception when massive term is hit.  Instead,\r\n    we now print this message to infoStream, if set:\r\n\r\n      WARNING: document contains at least one immense term (longer than the max length 16383), all of which were skipped.  Please correct the analyzer to not produce such terms.

I added comments at\r\n    the top of DocumentsWriter to explain aborting vs non-aborting\r\n    exceptions.  This change actually adds the infrastructure for\r\n    deleting by doc ID, which we've discussed adding to IW in the\r\n    past, but, I haven't exposed any public APIs for doing so.\r\n\r\n  * No longer log to infoStream how many docs were deleted on flush\r\n    since that deletion count is not accurate when mixing delete by\r\n    term and by docID.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2008-01-01T14:14:34.739+0000","updated":"2008-01-01T14:14:34.739+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385368/comment/12555225","id":"12555225","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"body":"I skimmed at the long token part of the patch:\r\n* In the test, why is the position increment of 'another' 3, \r\n  I think it should be 2?\r\n* assertEquals(\"failed document should not be in the index\",2,reader.numDocs());\r\n  should be \"document with skipped token should be in the index\"?\r\n* I believe that \"positon++\" in DocumentsWriter is not required because \r\n  invertField() already incremented the position before calling addPosition()?\r\n  (my fault, I suggested to still increment the position...)\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=doronc&avatarId=12738"},"displayName":"Doron Cohen","active":true},"created":"2008-01-01T22:27:51.737+0000","updated":"2008-01-01T22:27:51.737+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385368/comment/12555226","id":"12555226","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"{quote}\r\n* In the test, why is the position increment of 'another' 3,\r\nI think it should be 2?\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIt's not \"position increment\" that's 3, it's \"position\" that's 3?
