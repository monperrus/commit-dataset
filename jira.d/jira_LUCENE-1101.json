But when t2 calls t1 again (because t2 stopped r), that pos_incr should have bean cleared to 1. Now this can also be fixed by changing StopFilter to clear() before every call to t1.next(r), except for the first time it calls ts.next(), because for the first call it can assume that its consumer already cleared r. Since most words are not stopped, this distinction between first call to successive calls is important, performance wise.\r\n\r\nNow, this is a little complicated (and not only because of my writing style : - ) ), \r\nand so I think moving the clear() responsibility to the (deep most) producer would make things more simple and safe.
