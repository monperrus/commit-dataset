I actually think the patch looks pretty good though. Could you move the testcase into _MemoryIndexTest_ instead? We usually use a utility method to create a new directory & index writers in tests like this: \r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n Directory dir = newDirectory();\r\n MockAnalyzer mockAnalyzer = new MockAnalyzer(random());\r\n IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, newIndexWriterConfig(random(), TEST_VERSION_CURRENT, mockAnalyzer)); \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nI also think from looking at it the test must fail since you are not closing the index writer, index reader and the directory. I guess you should move most of it into a single method and only keep the _compareTermVectors_ in a sep. method. Additionally I think since your patch allows it we should also test the `offsetGap` could you add another test for this as well? If you do so feel free to add a _getOffsetGap(String)_ method to _MockAnalyzer_ so you can reuse your tests!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"created":"2014-02-14T07:43:41.056+0000","updated":"2014-02-14T07:43:41.056+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12695110/comment/13901318","id":"13901318","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=a2tirb","name":"a2tirb","emailAddress":"britta dot weber at elasticsearch dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"britta weber","active":true},"body":"Thanks a lot for the quick response!\r\nHere is a new patch with the requested changes.\r\n\r\nI added a method setOffsetGap(..) and getOffsetGap() to MockAnalyzer and now set the offsetGap random in the test, which sort of tests the gapOffset as well.
