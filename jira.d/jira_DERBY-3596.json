This connection has to be reset, which includes setting\r\n  the isolation level, resetting IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL and cleaning out\r\n  temporary tables.\r\n  The patch basically contains two parts: Detecting and handling a\r\n  deferred reset in DRDAConnThread and exposing / extending reset\r\n  functionality (the connection classes).\r\n  A drawback of this approach is that care must be taken to get the\r\n  reset logic correct.\r\n\r\n* 'derby-3596-2a-simple_approach.diff'\r\n  Solves the problem by simply closing the existing connection on the\r\n  server side before creating a new, if there is one.\r\n  Only a few lines of code.\r\n  This solution is far from optimal, since a physical connection is both\r\n  closed and created on the server for each logical connection on the\r\n  client side.\r\n\r\n* Optimal approach\r\n  This would probably be to rewrite the whole logic, both on the client\r\n  and the server side.

I get one error when I run the regression tests with it. The failure is in one of the new tests I wrote for JDBC statement pooling, so I have to look into the test and also check how statement pooling is affected by the fix.\r\n\r\nI do have some reservations about the more complex fix. Even though the approach is more optimal, the implementation is a bit hacky due to compatibility constraints. I wonder if it would be better to design and implement a proper mechanism at a later time.\r\nWill we ever roll a compatibility breaking release? If not, we have to code this using version checking and keep multiple implementations on both the client and server side.\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that there are more alternatives than the two I have suggested here. For instance, today we have Database and XADatabase. It might be possible to introduce a PoolingDatabase, taken we can detect when clients are indeed working with pooled connections. The difference between this one and the current complex fix, would be that the former would map client logical connections onto embedded logical connections, whereas the latter would map client logical connections directly onto a single embedded physical connection. This has some implications regarding connection state reset and object creation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll work a bit more on the test failure and getting a better grip on things.\r\nFeel free to add more comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2008-05-23T06:59:10.500+0000","updated":"2008-05-23T06:59:10.500+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12393122/comment/12599323","id":"12599323","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Regardless of which fix we choose, I think the changes to EmbedConnection.resetFromPool() should be part of it.
