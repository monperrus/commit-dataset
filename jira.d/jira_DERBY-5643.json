I'm not sure if that's what causing problems in the nightly testing, though.\r\n\r\nThe replication tests and the compatibility tests now call pingForServerUp() and wait until the server is up or a timeout happens, but they don't fail if a timeout happens. The attached patch (fail-on-timeout.diff) makes those tests check the return value of pingForServerUp() and fail if the server did not come up in time.\r\n\r\nThe patch also changes how AutoloadTest.testAutoNetworkServerBoot() verifies that the server did not come up. In the existing code, it pings until the timeout happens, and then returns successfully. This took 40 seconds before the timeout was changed, and now it takes 4 minutes. The timeout is not supposed to affect tests under normal operation, so it should not have pinged that long in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe patch makes the test wait for a shorter time (5 seconds) before concluding that the server didn't come up. This may cause bugs to go unnoticed on very slow machines (if the server comes up when it shouldn't, but it takes more than 5 seconds), but it will speed up the test considerably and still detect the problem on reasonably fast machines.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-03-19T17:28:37.923+0000","updated":"2012-03-19T17:28:37.923+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545792/comment/13233333","id":"13233333","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 1302811.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-03-20T09:51:34.876+0000","updated":"2012-03-20T09:51:34.876+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545792/comment/13233822","id":"13233822","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikem","name":"mikem","emailAddress":"mikem_app at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mike Matrigali","active":true},"body":"got 7 failures in nightly tests on ibm16 and ibm17.  are these the kinds of problems you expect to be fixed by changes in this JIRA?
