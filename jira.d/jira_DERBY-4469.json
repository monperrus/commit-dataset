This patch makes it possible to cast nulls and untyped ? parameters as UDTs. More tests will need to be written to verify that casting from builtin types to UDTs and vice-versa does not work. Some additional logic will need to be written to handle the case when a UDT is bound to one of the Java types which correspond to Derby's SQL types (e.g., String, Integer, etc.).
