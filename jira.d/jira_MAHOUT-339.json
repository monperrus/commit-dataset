This preprocessing was already being done in the synthetic control job - which converts delimited text to canopies - so the canopies could not be cast to vectors in the clustering job. I've added an optional boolean inputIsClusters argument to the MeanShiftCanopyJob.runJob so that the redundant conversion can be omitted if a preprocessing step has already produced canopies. Running tests now. Will commit once they are done.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeastman","name":"jeastman","emailAddress":"jeff at windwardsolutions dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232"},"displayName":"Jeff Eastman","active":true},"created":"2010-04-02T21:05:05.733+0000","updated":"2010-04-02T21:05:05.733+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459436/comment/12852967","id":"12852967","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeastman","name":"jeastman","emailAddress":"jeff at windwardsolutions dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232"},"displayName":"Jeff Eastman","active":true},"body":"r930402 committed the fix","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeastman","name":"jeastman","emailAddress":"jeff at windwardsolutions dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jeastman&avatarId=12232"},"displayName":"Jeff Eastman","active":true},"created":"2010-04-02T21:53:13.233+0000","updated":"2010-04-02T21:53:13.233+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAHOUT-339/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04b73:"}}
