When the hostName provided is *not* localhost, the harness switches to startServer=false (i.e. no starting and stopping the server) and useprocess=false (i.e. do not start a separate process).\r\n\r\nI have modified various tests that run in the derbynetclientmats suite to check for this property. And I had to modify certain tests so they could correctly find the supported files in extin or extinout directories when run like this. Also had to modify various tests to filter out localhost and to ensure tests cleaned up after themselves.\r\n\r\nI have had to add a DerbyNetRemote.exclude and DerbyNetClientRemote.exclude because some tests try to look at files created by the server, or use NetworkServerControl in ways not appropriate when the server is on a remote host. \r\n\r\nI have modified the testing README with instructions on how to start the network server on the remote host. \r\n\r\nI have run derbyall and found 3 problems with store tests (which satheesh fixed), 2 intermittent problems (ConcurrentImplicitCreateSchema and DerbyNetAutoStart), and 2 suprising failures (resultsetStream and characterStreams.java) which I think are due to some mysterious other problem in my setup. (problem persisted when I backed out my changes, and when I copied relevant files to another environment, this did not exist there). In addition, I ran derbynetclientmats and derbynetmats against a remote host and found no problems - except that the CompatibilityTest plops away with an exception.\r\nI will analyze that next and provide a follow up for that.\r\n\r\nI know Sunitha (who needs this for testing her network server service) and manjula (who need this for testing the ipv6) are both on vacation, but I would appreciate someone looking at this...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2005-12-16T04:55:55.000+0000","updated":"2005-12-16T04:55:55.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12311788/comment/12361126","id":"12361126","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"body":"Committed to trunk with revision 358591.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"created":"2005-12-23T02:30:35.000+0000","updated":"2005-12-23T02:30:35.000+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-413/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i078fz:"}}
