This patch fixes this so formatter doesnt have to deal with it, and there is no AIOOBE or strange checks in the formatter.\r\n\r\nThe test you write is for different behavior: it saying, if the passage itself spans the content boundary, don't present it to the formatter at all. But, this is sorta a different issue, its already handled here today by Math.min and the formatter never has to deal with it:\r\n{code}\r\n        // advance breakiterator\r\n        assert BreakIterator.DONE < 0;\r\n        current.startOffset = Math.max(bi.preceding(start+1), 0);\r\n        current.endOffset = Math.min(bi.next(), contentLength);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf we want to change the behavior for this, thats cool too, but its not really related to the bug at hand. I am not opposed to fixing it, but one problem would be someone using stuff like WholeBreakIterator, though we could \"solve\" it in a different way by having WholeBreakIterator take in the limit itself (I dont know if this would address your concern though).\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2013-08-12T15:48:13.035+0000","updated":"2013-08-12T15:48:13.035+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663155/comment/13736971","id":"13736971","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"OK let's not try to address that on this issue ...
