against the length.\r\nUsing the example from the report;\r\n o current: 11 + 10 > 20 = true (exception thrown)\r\n o with patch: (11 -1) + 10 > 20 = false (check passes)\r\n\r\nI made some more changes to the test code. Three tests were added, one for Blob and two for Clob (one Clob loaded with latin chars only, one loaded with CJK chars).\r\nIn addition, CharAlphabet-objects cannot be shared between readers. I dealt with this by adding getClone method to the CharAlphabet-class, and getting a clone when creating the LoopingAlphabetReader. This should maybe be changed in a more robust way.\r\nIt should also be noted that the method draining the stream and returning the last byte/char, performs more checks than usual.\r\n\r\nPatch ready for review.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot
