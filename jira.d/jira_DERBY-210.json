It does not solve the entire memory leak problem. \r\n\r\nPreparedStatement references are stored by client driver at following places:\r\n1. In org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection, they are added to java.util.LinkedList 'openStatements_' \r\n2.

But I have narrowed it down to this:\r\n\r\nThe only other reference holding on to the PreparedStatement is in the ResultSet object which remains alive till the PreparedStatement is closed. ResultSet does not get garbage-collected even after ResultSet.close() is called. It gets ready for grabage-collection only when the statement which created it is closed. This is because client driver holds references to ResultSets in a Hashtable 'positionedUpdateCursorNameToResultSet_' in SectionManager object. All ResultSets get added to this Hashtable  though only ResultSets from positioned update statements are retrieved and used from this table. Also, only ResultSets of positioned update statements get removed from the HashTable. Other ResultSets remain in the Hashtable. So ResultSet objects cannot get finalized even after ResultSet.close() is called. Because ResultSet has reference to the PreparedStatement object, it also does not get garbage-collected.\r\n\r\nHowever, when PreparedStatement.close() is called, the section used by the statement is freed and gets re-used by new statements. Server cursor names are associated with a section and so the new statement uses the same server cursor name as previous statement (which has been closed). And ResultSet from new statement gets added to the HashTable with same cursor name as used by previous statement. So the Hashtable value gets over-written and previous ResultSet is now free for garbage collection. And the previous PreparedStatement is also free.\r\n\r\nTo verify this, I added following line to the method Statement.resetCursorNameAndRemoveFromWhereCurrentOfMappings\r\n\r\n//Also remove resultset mapping for other cursors\r\nagent_.sectionManager_.removeCursorNameToResultSetMapping(cursorName_,\r\n                    section_.getServerCursorName());\r\n\r\nIt was only doing this:\r\nagent_.sectionManager_.removeCursorNameToResultSetMapping(cursorName_,\r\n                    section_.getServerCursorNameForPositionedUpdate());\r\n\r\nWith this change and  changes from derby-210-patch1.diff, prepared statements get garbage collected even if the user does not explicitly close them. I could run the attached repro derbyStress.java with 40000 prepared statements. I also successfully ran derbynetclientmats.\r\n\r\nAdding the above line seems to solve the problem. But there seems to be some extra work going on in client driver in just adding and removing \"all\" result sets to the Hashtable 'positionedUpdateCursorNameToResultSet_'. I think this can be avoided. I am trying to understand why positionedUpdateCursorNameToResultSet_ is needed. In the meantime, I'd appreciate any feedback to know that I am in right direction.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2006-01-14T11:19:14.000+0000","updated":"2006-01-14T11:19:14.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31585/comment/12362711","id":"12362711","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"If I understand your comment correctly, you feel that you now have a correct fix, which avoids the memory leaks; however, you are concerned that there is a performance problem because the tracking of the ResultSet objects in the SectionManager hashtable is in some or all cases unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn that case, my opinion is that you should commit the correctness fix now, and file the performance issue as a separate bug and address it separately.\r\n\r\nI will try to take a closer look at your changes over the next week and I will let you know if I have any other comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-01-14T11:38:47.000+0000","updated":"2006-01-14T11:38:47.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31585/comment/12362873","id":"12362873","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"body":"I am uploading a combined patch 'derby-210.diff' which solves the memory leak.

They do not have to wait till the Connection object is collected.\r\n       - 'openStatements_' in org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection\r\n       - 'CommitAndRollbackListeners_' in org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection\r\n\r\n* Removes the list 'RollbackOnlyListeners_' since this is not being used.\r\n\r\n* Updates the following comment for openStatements_:\r\n// Since DERBY prepared statements must be re-prepared after a commit,\r\n// then we must traverse this list after a commit and notify statements\r\n// that they are now in an un-prepared state.\r\nfinal java.util.LinkedList openStatements_ = new java.util.LinkedList();\r\n\r\nIn the code, I did not see this list being traversed after a commit to re-prepare statements. Also, I think this is not needed since Derby does not require re-prepare of statements after a commit. Currently, this list is used to close all open statements when the originating connection is closed.\r\n\r\n* Removes all ResultSets from HashTable 'positionedUpdateCursorNameToResultSet_' in SectionManager. Only result sets of positioned update statements were being removed from this hashtable whereas all result sets were added. Because of this, client driver was holding on to result sets and statements even after rs.close() was called.\r\n\r\n* Adds a test 'derbyStress.java' to jdbcapi suite. This test is based on the repro for this patch. Without this patch, it fails when run with client driver. Kathey had suggested in another mail that tests for client memory leak problems (DERBY-557, DERBY-210) can be added to same test. I did not see an existing test. So I created this new test. If DERBY-557 does not have a test, I think it can be added to this new test.\r\n\r\n* Excludes the new test from running with jcc because jcc gives out of memory error. \r\n\r\n* Creates 'derbyStress_app.properties' with following property 'jvmflags=-Xmx64M' to guarantee the test fails on all machines.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully ran derbyall with Sun JDK 1.4.2 on Windows XP. Please take a look at this patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2006-01-17T03:28:27.000+0000","updated":"2006-01-17T03:28:27.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31585/comment/12362900","id":"12362900","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Committed this patch.\r\n\r\nDate: Mon Jan 16 16:10:58 2006\r\nNew Revision: 369612\r\n\r\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=369612&view=rev\r\n\r\nThank you Deepa for resolving this important client issue.

I tried to trace the client to see from where this commit was coming from. But turning on client trace made this problem go away. I tried to create a smaller repro for the problem but was not able to simulate this failure. Also, the test was failing only on \"Sun JDK 1.5.0_02\". If I even slightly change the order in the test, this problem goes away. So the failure was sporadic but happens consistently with the updatableResultSet test on Sun JDK 1.5.0_02. I am glad we caught this problem on this jvm. Because after debugging, I realize this can occur on any jvm/platform. It just depends on when the garbage collector (GC) runs. \r\n\r\nSince my patch changed when statements get garbage collected, I walked through that path and found that it was the GC that was sending this commit to network server. When a statement object gets ready for garbage collection, GC calls it's finalize() method. The finalize() method in Statement class actually calls closeX() which does the same things as Statement.close() method.  When autocommit is on, in some cases, this will call connection_.writeAutoCommit() as shown by this code snippet from Statement.writeCloseResultSets. This causes a commit to be sent to network server and if this happens at wrong time, the output becomes erroneous. \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nif (connection_.autoCommit_ && requiresAutocommit && isAutoCommittableStatement_) {\r\n\tconnection_.writeAutoCommit();\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis problem will not occur without my patch because of this:\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\nWithout my patch: \r\n--------------------------------\r\nStatements get free for garbage collection:\r\n * ONLY after they are explicitly closed (Statement.close() has been called) or the connection itself is closed. \r\n AND\r\n * when the user application has no more references to the Statement\r\n \r\nIn this case, when GC claims a statement object, it would have been closed already. Because of this, when finalize() --> closeX() is called, openOnClient_ is false and hence finalize() method returns without calling closeX().\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nprotected void finalize() throws java.lang.Throwable {\r\n        if (agent_.loggingEnabled()) {\r\n            agent_.logWriter_.traceEntry(this, \"finalize\");\r\n        }\r\n        if (openOnClient_) {\r\n            synchronized (connection_) {\r\n                closeX();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        super.finalize();\r\n}\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\nWith my patch: \r\n--------------------------------\r\nStatements get free for garbage collection:\r\n  * when the user application has no more references to the Statement\r\nwhich I think is the correct behavior. \r\n\r\nIn this case, when GC claims a statement object, openOnClient_ will be true if no Statement.close() has been called previously. Because of this, finalize() --> closeX() is called. And it goes through the entire chain of actions which happen in closeX(). One of this is a call to connection_.writeAutoCommit() which sends a RDBCMM to the server and server does a commit. By chance if the commit message is recieved after the execution of a statement which is not supposed to be autocommitted (like the updateRow statement), this causes erroneous behavior.\r\n\r\nI verified using printlns that this commit is getting sent from Statement.writeCloseResultSets. Also ran the test after removing call to closeX() from Statement.finalize(), in which case this problem goes away. This call to closeX() seems to be the cause of the problem. I am yet to figure out what subset of actions need to be done in finalize().\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\nSummary:\r\n--------------------------------\r\nI think my patch for derby-210 is doing the right thing by preventing statement leaks. However, with my patch, some paths of code are getting visited for first time from the GC thread. This is causing sporadic failures because the finalize method in statement class (I think) does a lot more things than required,  one of them being sending commit message to the server. I think the statement finalizer should not be sending anything to the network server, at least not at connection level. I have to look some more into the finalizers in client classes and what happens at server side before I can re-submit a patch for this. I thought I'll post this to see what others think.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any feedback on this.

It is not ready for commit. This patch contains changes in my first patch and some additional changes which I am describing below. I would appreciate if someone can read this and let me know if this is the right approach.\r\n\r\nThe changes numbered 1-7 were done as part of first patch. I am copying it from my previous comment:\r\n\r\n1. Eliminates the below references to PreparedStatement objects by using WeakHashMap instead of LinkedList. When there are no other references to the keys in a WeakHashMap, they will get removed from the map and can thus get garbage-collected. They do not have to wait till the Connection object is collected.\r\n       - 'openStatements_' in org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection\r\n       - 'CommitAndRollbackListeners_' in org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection\r\n\r\n2. Removes the list 'RollbackOnlyListeners_' since this is not being used.\r\n\r\n3. Updates the following comment for openStatements_:\r\n// Since DERBY prepared statements must be re-prepared after a commit,\r\n// then we must traverse this list after a commit and notify statements\r\n// that they are now in an un-prepared state.\r\nfinal java.util.LinkedList openStatements_ = new java.util.LinkedList();\r\n\r\nIn the code, I did not see this list being traversed after a commit to re-prepare statements. Also, I think this is not needed since Derby does not require re-prepare of statements after a commit. Currently, this list is used to close all open statements when the originating connection is closed.\r\n\r\n4. Removes all ResultSets from HashTable 'positionedUpdateCursorNameToResultSet_' in SectionManager. Only result sets of positioned update statements were being removed from this hashtable whereas all result sets were added. Because of this, client driver was holding on to result sets and statements even after rs.close() was called.\r\n\r\n5. Adds a test 'derbyStress.java' to jdbcapi suite. This test is based on the repro for this patch. Without this patch, it fails when run with client driver. Kathey had suggested in another mail that tests for client memory leak problems (DERBY-557, DERBY-210) can be added to same test. I did not see an existing test. So I created this new test. If DERBY-557 does not have a test, I think it can be added to this new test.\r\n\r\n6. Excludes the new test from running with jcc because jcc gives out of memory error.\r\n\r\n7. Creates 'derbyStress_app.properties' with following property 'jvmflags=-Xmx64M' to guarantee the test fails on all machines.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the memory leak mentioned in this issue was solved but it was causing an intermittent failure in lang/updatableResultSet.java as described in  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-210#action_12363439. To solve the regression caused by the first patch, I changed the finalizer in Statement and PreparedStatement classes to avoid network operations. Changes are:\r\n\r\n8. In PreparedStatement class, the finalizer was calling closeX method, which was doing:\r\n\t* Call super.closeX() ---> Statement.closeX()\r\n\t* Cleanup parameter objects - parameterMetaData_, sql_, parameters_ array\r\n\t* Remove the PreparedStatement from connection_.CommitAndRollbackListeners_ list\r\n\t\r\n   Changes done by patch:\r\n   \t* Move cleanup of objects to a new method cleanupParameters()\r\n   \t* Call the new method cleanupParameters() from closeX() and finalize()\r\n   \t* In finalize() method, call super.finalize() which is Statement.finalize() and it will do the remaining cleanup\r\n   \t* Since WeakHashMap is used for Connection.CommitAndRollbackListeners_, the prepared statement object would already have been removed from this list before entering the finalizer. So there is no need to explicitly call a remove in the finalizer.\r\n\r\n9. In Statement class, the finalizer was calling closeX method, which was doing:\r\n\t* Close any open cursors for this statement on the server.\r\n\t\t- If result set is open on server, send CLSQRY to the server.\r\n\t\t- check if autocommit is required when closing result sets and flow a commit to server, if required\r\n\t* Call Statement.markClosed(), which does\r\n\t\t- Mark close the result sets on the client\r\n\t\t- If cursor name was set on the statement, remove it from Connection.clientCursorNameCache_\r\n\t\t- Call markClosed() on prepared statements for auto generated keys\r\n\t\t- Call markClosedOnServer(), which frees up the section. The freed section will be re-used by new statements.\r\n\t* Remove the Statement from Connection.openStatements_ list\t\r\n\t* Cleanup ResultSetMetaData\r\n\t\r\n    Changes done by patch:\t\r\n        * Move the cleanup of ResultSetMetaData into markClosed() method. This will keep all client-side cleanup in markClosed(). \r\n        * Change the finalizer to just call markClosed(). This method frees up client-side resources and operates on synchronized collections. So I have removed the synchronize block from the finalizer. markClosed() in turn calls markClosedOnServer(), which frees up a section. When the section gets re-used by new statement on client, server re-uses the same statement. newDrdaStatement in org.apache.derby.impl.drda.Database has this code:\r\n        \t\r\n        \t\t/**\r\n\t\t\t * Get a new DRDA statement and store it in the stmtTable if stortStmt is true\r\n\t\t\t * If possible recycle an existing statement\r\n\t\t\t * If we are asking for one with the same name it means it\r\n\t\t\t * was already closed.\r\n\t\t\t * @param pkgnamcsn  Package name and section\r\n\t\t\t * @return DRDAStatement  \r\n\t\t\t */\r\n\t\t\tprotected DRDAStatement newDRDAStatement(Pkgnamcsn pkgnamcsn)\r\n\t\t\tthrows SQLException\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tDRDAStatement stmt = getDRDAStatement(pkgnamcsn);\r\n\t\t\t\tif (stmt != null)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstmt.close();\r\n\t\t\t\telse\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstmt = new DRDAStatement(this);\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstmt.setPkgnamcsn(pkgnamcsn);\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstoreStatement(stmt);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\treturn stmt;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n        \t\r\n    \r\nIn the above method, close() is called before re-using the DRDAStatement. This will ensure the statement state is restored. DRDAStatement.close() also ensures the result set objects are closed and result set tables and all result sets are freed on server side. So there is no need to send explicit CLSQRY from client-side statement finalizer.\r\n    \t* Since WeakHashMap is used for Connection.openStatements_, the statement object would already have been removed from this list before entering the finalizer. So there is no need to explicitly call a remove in the finalizer.\r\n    \t* The autocommit logic does not exist in the finalizer since only markClosed() is called from finalizer. This will avoid untimely commits which was causing the regression in the test lang/updatableResultSet.java.\r\n    \t\r\nWith the above changes, I ran derbynetclientmats few times with jdk14 and jdk15. All tests passed except an intermittent failure in derbynet/prepStmt.java. This was happening in the test added for Jira125 where it calls rs.next(). I was getting the following exception:\r\n\r\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 25242\r\n\tat java.lang.String.checkBounds(String.java:372)\r\n\tat java.lang.String.<init>(String.java:404)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.client.net.NetCursor.readFdocaString(NetCursor.java:753)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.client.net.NetCursor.parseVCS(NetCursor.java:726)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.client.net.NetCursor.parseSQLCAXGRP(NetCursor.java:693)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.client.net.NetCursor.parseSQLCAGRP(NetCursor.java:622)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.client.net.NetCursor.parseSQLCARD(NetCursor.java:595)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.client.net.NetCursor.calculateColumnOffsetsForRow_(NetCursor.java:112)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.client.am.Cursor.next(Cursor.java:165)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.client.am.ResultSet.nextX(ResultSet.java:287)\r\n\tat org.apache.derby.client.am.ResultSet.next(ResultSet.java:259)\r\n\tat org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.derbynet.prepStmt.jira125Test_a(prepStmt.java:904)\r\n\tat org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.derbynet.prepStmt.jira125Test(prepStmt.java:820)\r\n\tat org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.derbynet.prepStmt.main(prepStmt.java:313)\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that on the client side, the cleanup was happening correctly but on server side, the statement re-use was not happening correctly. DRDAStatement.close() was restoring all members except 'currentDrdaRs' and 'needsToSendParamData'. \r\n\r\n10. I added the following to DRDAStatement.close() method. This will ensure the previous result set is freed. \r\n\t\tcurrentDrdaRs = new DRDAResultSet();\r\n\t\tneedsToSendParamData = false;\r\n\r\nWith this change, I am running derbynetclientmats in a loop. I did not see any failures so far. I also ran the repro derbyStress.java with 50,000 prepared statements and did not get an out of memory error. \r\n\r\nI am attaching this interim draft patch to get feedback about the changes. Please let me know if this approach is okay.

More people are likely to see the changes when they are in the code than when they are in a patch file.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djd","name":"djd","emailAddress":"djd at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel John Debrunner","active":true},"created":"2006-02-10T13:35:55.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-10T13:35:55.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31585/comment/12365950","id":"12365950","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"body":"Attaching a patch 'derby-210-patch1.diff' which removes the list 'RollbackOnlyListeners_' from org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection class since this is not being used.

It will cleanup the objects specific to PreparedStatement, which are ParameterMetaData and parameters. It also removes the PreparedStatement form the list in Connection object. \r\n    \r\n2. In Statement class, the finalizer was calling closeX method, which was doing:\r\n    * Close any open cursors for this statement on the server.\r\n           - If result set is open on server, send CLSQRY to the server.\r\n           - check if autocommit is required when closing result sets and flow a commit to server, if required\r\n    * Call Statement.markClosed(), which does\r\n             - Mark close the result sets on the client\r\n             - If cursor name was set on the statement, remove it from Connection.clientCursorNameCache_\r\n             - Call markClosed() on prepared statements for auto generated keys\r\n             - Call markClosedOnServer(), which frees up the section. The freed section will be re-used by new statements.\r\n    * Remove the Statement from Connection.openStatements_ list\r\n    * Cleanup ResultSetMetaData\r\n\r\n    Changes done by patch:\r\n        * Move the cleanup of ResultSetMetaData and remove of Statement from Connection.openStatements_ list into markClosed() method. This will keep all client-side cleanup in markClosed().\r\n        * Change the finalizer to just call markClosed(). This method frees up client-side resources and operates on synchronized collections. So I have removed the synchronize block from the finalizer. \r\n     * The autocommit logic does not exist in the finalizer since only markClosed() is called from finalizer. This will avoid untimely commits which was causing the regression in the test lang/updatableResultSet.java\r\n\r\nWith this patch, I ran derbynetclientmats with  Sun JDK1.4.2 on Windows XP.\r\n\r\nJust before submitting this, I was re-reading the patch and noticed there is no need to override close and closeX method in PreparedStatement since these methods are doing exactly same things as the methods in Statement class. close() method in both classes just call closeX. And closeX does server-side cleanup and calls markClosed. And markClosed in PreparedStatement calls the super.markClosed. So there is no need for a close() and closeX() in PreparedStatement. This is possible because of the name change suggested by Bryan. Thanks again. I hope this change is okay. I will re-run derbynetclientmats and will submit a revised patch4. \r\n\r\nBryan, if you get time, I would appreciate if you can look at this patch and let me know if it covers your comments.

This patch is in preparation for the fixes to memory leaks. \r\n\r\nSummary of changes: \r\n\r\n* Changes the finalizers in Statement classes to do only client-side cleanup. No network operations are done in the finalizers.\r\n\r\n* Adds markClosed method to PreparedStatement class which overrides the markClosed method in Statement class. All client-side cleanup code is moved to markClosed method. Two forms of markClosed method are added:\r\n\r\n    - markClosed() method will perform clean up but will not remove Statement from the open statements list and PreparedStatement from the commit and rollback listeners list in org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection. This method is called from finalize(), Connection#markStatementsClosed(), and to close positioned update statements. For the finaizer to be called, the Statement should not have any references and so it should have been already removed from the lists.  Connection#markStatementsClosed method explicitly removes the Statement from open statements list. Positioned update statements are not added to the open statements list. Hence, markClosed() is called in these cases.\r\n\r\n    - markClosed(true) will additionally remove the statement objects from the lists. This is called from close() method.\r\n\r\n* After these changes, it is not required to override close(), closeX() and finalize() methods in PreparedStatement class since they contain same code as in Statement class. So these methods are removed.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, I ran derbynetclientmats with Sun JDK 1.4.2. jdbcapi/dbMetaDataJdbc30.java failed.

In my work for DERBY-210, I found objects added to these lists is one of the causes of memory leak. Solution that was suggested by you and Bernt was to use weak references in these lists. In my patch proposal, I have mentioned use of WeakHashMap instead of LinkedList. \r\n\r\nI tried to see if I can remove these lists but thought it to be too disruptive since the usage of these lists is not very clear. So I have opened DERBY-817 for further work on these lists. Please check DERBY-817 to see if it answers some of your questions. \r\n\r\nI am trying to summarize my understanding about these lists: \r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nopenStatements_ : \r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* What is it used for?  \r\nWhen Connection.close() is called, this list is checked to get a list of open statements and statements are marked closed and removed from the list. This happens in Connection.markStatementsClosed() method. They also are used in reset method called by ClientPooledConnection to reset statements when re-using the same physical connection.\r\n\r\n* What is added and when? \r\nAll statement objects, except positioned update statements, are added to this list. This happens in createStatement and prepare* methods in Connection class. For positioned update statements, there is a comment in the code in Connection.preparePositionedUpdateStatement: \r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        // The positioned update statement is not added to the list of open statements,\r\n        // because this would cause a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException when\r\n        // iterating thru the list of open statements to call completeRollback().\r\n        // An updatable result set is marked closed on a call to completeRollback(),\r\n        // and would therefore need to close the positioned update statement associated with the result set which would cause\r\n        // it to be removed from the open statements list. Resulting in concurrent modification\r\n        // on the open statements list.\r\n        // Notice that ordinary Statement.closeX() is never called on the positioned update statement,\r\n        // rather markClosed() is called to avoid trying to remove the statement from the openStatements_ list.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* What is removed and when (finalize/close/some other time) ? \r\nCurrently, removal happens when 1) Connection is closed 2) Statement is (explicitly) closed. 3) Code to *remove_from_list* is also there is the finalize method call path. But this is a no-op since finalize() will get called only when there are no references to objects in any lists.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nCommitAndRollbackListeners_ : \r\n------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n* What is it used for?\r\nPlease see DERBY-817. It seems like this list is not needed at least for purposes indicated by comment. This may need further investigation.\r\n\r\n* What is added and when? \r\nPreparedStatements, ResultSets and Lobs are added to this list from their listenToUnitOfWork() methods.\r\n\r\n* What is removed and when (finalize/close/some other time) ? \r\nFor all three types of objects, removal happens in their completeLocalCommit and completeLocalRollback methods. For PreparedStatement and ResultSet, they are also removed from this list when they are closed.  \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhat patch4 (it changes finalization of statement objects) does to removal from these lists :\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRemoval of statement objects from these two lists is moved to markClosed method. With respect to these lists, whatever was previosuly done by markClosed() method remains unchanged. A new method markClosed(boolean removeListener) is added to distinguish when the objects will be removed from the list. markClosed(true) is only called from close() methods. In this case, there is no change from previous behaviour since the following was previously done in close() method:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n            markClosed();\r\n            connection_.openStatements_.remove(this);\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nand now it is replaced with\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n           markClosed(true);\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, finalize method code path also had *remove_from_list* call. But this would never be visited. For finalize to be called, there should not be any reference to the statement object from any lists. Applying the same logic, in the patch, finalize just calls markClosed(), which does not have *remove_from_list* call. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps you in continuing to read the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2006-02-18T09:03:43.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-18T09:03:43.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31585/comment/12366880","id":"12366880","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Statement.finalize() comment says\r\n\r\n * This method cleans up client-side resources by calling markClosed().\r\n * It is different from close() method, which also does clean up on server.\r\n\r\n\r\nand the comment for closeX() says\r\n/**\r\n     * An untraced version of close().

How do they get cleaned up?\r\nThe statement and result sets for generated keys query get cleaned up in Statement.markClosed() by call to markPreparedStatementForAutoGeneratedKeysClosed() method. This method calls markClosed on the auto-generated keys statement, which will ensure this statement and its result sets are cleaned on client side. The cleanup on server happens when section is re-used.\r\n\r\n1) Somehow all of this causes the section to be reused. So, while we won't have immediate cleanup on the server, it will happen if the section is reused. Can you explain this process a bit more? \r\nAs part of Statement.markClosed(), markClosedOnServer() method gets called. This method frees up the Section on the client. A stack is used to store the free sections. Hence, client driver will use this freed section for the next statement. When client driver re-uses the freed section, network server will find a statement with this section in its stmtTable and re-use the statement. This happens in Database.newDrdaStatement method in network server. Before re-using the statement, its close method is called. This close method cleans up the statement state and its current result set. All other resultsets in its result set table are freed. \r\n\r\nIf you find these explanations are correct, I'll upload a revised version of patch4 with more comments.\r\n\r\nAs you said, the code in patch4 will be not be fully covered by tests currently. The code in finalize method will be covered only after the patch which removes the memory leaks is reviewed and committed. This is in my next patch (patch5 - which removes the memory leaks + enable derbyStress test). I will run tests with patch4 + patch 5 and submit patch5, if that will help testing/reviewing.\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to do a long running test with patch4+patch5 before committing them. I'll be running the repro derbyStress.java with 1M prepared statements and will check client and server memory usage. Other than that, it may be good to run the patch through DOTS test. I do not have the DOTS setup. I would appreciate if John or anyone else has the setup for DOTS and will be willing to run the tests after I upload the new patches. Anyone has suggestions for other tests I can run to test this?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2006-02-19T12:47:18.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-19T12:47:18.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31585/comment/12366967","id":"12366967","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"I am rephrasing this comment.

So I changed finalize to not send any network commands. \r\n\r\nBut this will not work well for Kathey's scenario, where an application keeps all its statement references and dereferences all of them in the end. With my change in finalize, the result sets will get cleaned up only when client driver re-uses a section number for a new statement which will make network server close it's statement and free up result sets OR when the connection is closed.\r\n\r\nOn first look, Kathey's scenario seemed highly improbable but I guess an application can do that if it stores references to statements in some hashtable. I will try to create a repro for Kathey's scenario and add this case to derbyStress.java and see the behaviour with my patches.\r\n\r\nI'm reworking finalize method to continue sending CLSQRY as Kathey suggested and will upload new version of patch 4.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2006-02-20T09:20:21.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-20T09:20:21.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31585/comment/12367031","id":"12367031","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Thanks Deepa.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this test case would show if the ResultSets are being closed.\r\n- create a table  and insert a few rows with more than 32K of data. \r\n- create a prepared statement to drop the table.\r\n- fetch 1 row\r\n- dereference the statement\r\n- force garbage collection\r\n- try to drop the table with the prepared statement.\r\n\r\nI t hink if the ResultSet  is not closed on garbage collection, you will not be able to drop the table.\r\nI have not tried this, but just a thought.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2006-02-20T22:27:33.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-20T22:27:33.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31585/comment/12367089","id":"12367089","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"body":"Thanks Kathey for the test case.

With current client code, if we don't close a result set explicitly, it's statement object will not be freed. This is because result set gets added to 'positionedUpdateCursorNameToResultSet_'  table in SectionManager. The result set object gets removed from this table only when ResultSet.markClosed() gets called.

The previous patches were doing preliminary work to fix the client-side finalization and network server object re-use. This patch removes the actual memory leaks.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSummary of patch:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1. Eliminates the below references to PreparedStatement objects by using WeakHashMap instead of LinkedList. When there are no other references to the keys in a WeakHashMap, they will get removed from the map and can thus get garbage-collected. They do not have to wait till the Connection object is collected.\r\n       - 'openStatements_' in org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection\r\n       - 'CommitAndRollbackListeners_' in org.apache.derby.client.am.Connection\r\n\r\n2. Updates the following comment for openStatements_:\r\n// Since DERBY prepared statements must be re-prepared after a commit,\r\n// then we must traverse this list after a commit and notify statements\r\n// that they are now in an un-prepared state.\r\nfinal java.util.LinkedList openStatements_ = new java.util.LinkedList();\r\n\r\nIn the code, I did not see this list being traversed after a commit to re-prepare statements. Also, I think this is not needed since Derby does not require re-prepare of statements after a commit. Currently, this list is used to close all open statements when the originating connection is closed.\r\n\r\n3. Removes all ResultSets from HashTable 'positionedUpdateCursorNameToResultSet_' in SectionManager. Only result sets of positioned update statements were being removed from this hashtable whereas all result sets were added. Because of this, client driver was holding on to result sets and statements even after rs.close() was called.\r\n\r\n4. Modifies the test jdbcapi/derbyStress.java to run the test for derby-210. The test was checked in as patch2  but disabled for client framework.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOpen items related to this issue\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n* http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-817 (Improvements to Network Client driver - analyze/improve use of java collection classes in the code) - This issue lists some potential problem areas and cleanup tasks identified in the client driver code.\r\n\r\n* http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1002 (Check that DRDAStatement and DRDAResultSet states are reset when they are re-used) - This issue was blocking DERBY-210. Patch for the blocking issue has been committed. There is still some minor cleanup to be done in this issue.\r\n\r\n* http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1021 (Perform cleanup actions which require synchronization outside the finalizer) - This issue is linked to (\"is part of\") DERBY-210. Maybe, it is easier if I had made this a sub-task of DERBY-210. I will close DERBY-1021 and open a sub-task for 210 with details about work needed on the finalizer.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, I ran the following tests on Windows XP:\r\n* derbynetclientmats suite 6 times on my machine (3 times with Sun JDK1.4.2 and 3 times with Sun JDK1.5). No failures. \r\n\r\n* repro with 100,000 statements and checked the memory usage on client and server. No spikes in memory usage. Without this patch, the repro used to give OutOfMemory error after executing 950 statements. Tests run with Sun JDK1.4.2 with 64M heap space .\r\n\r\n* test to compare memory usage when statements_are_not_explicitly_closed vs statements_are_explicitly_closed. Tests run with Sun JDK1.4.2 with 64M heap space.\r\n   case1: repro with 5000 statements \r\n   case2: modified_repro_which_explicitly_closes_prepared_statements with 5000 statements. \r\nI compared the memory usage on client and server in these two cases and saw that memory usage over time is similar. Memory usage is calculated as Runtime.totalMemory() - Runtime.freeMemory().\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if someone can take a look at this patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2006-03-02T10:35:55.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-02T10:35:55.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/31585/comment/12368518","id":"12368518","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnemb","name":"johnemb","emailAddress":"johnemb at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John H.
