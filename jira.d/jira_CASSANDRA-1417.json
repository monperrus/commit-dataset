Loading it is as simple as calling getColumnFamily (with a zero-column predicate) on each row, for row cache.\r\n\r\nKey cache is more complicated, but only a little.  First is that you have to de-duplicate the row keys from multiple sstables.  (Saving which sstable version it's associated with is less useful, since that will be obsoleted by compaction.)  Second is that we don't need to actually read any row data, we just need to go through the index locator part of the read path (getPosition).","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12454028","id":"12454028","filename":"1417-cassandra-0.6.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mdennis","name":"mdennis","emailAddress":"mdennis at riptano dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matthew F.

crypto.Data are being added\r\n - we don't want to add a setting for loading cache on startup; if a cache is present, it should be loaded\r\n - we DO want a setting for how often to save cache (default should be: not at all)\r\n - cache saving should be done at compaction priority.  may mean you need to use an executor instead of a timer to get that level of control\r\n - tmp cleanup should be in CFS constructor (0.6) / scrubDataDirectories (0.7), not CassandraDaemon.  similarly, loadRowCache should probably be called by CFS constructor\r\n - we only care about cache keys during save, so getEntrySet should be getKeys\r\n - avoid the temptation to mix unrelated refactoring like the CFMetaData and DD changes here into patches like this (this is where git comes in handy, you can easilysave them off for separate review later)\r\n - SavedCacheReader is a class with no fields, should probably just be a static method somewhere (SSTable?).  also, should return a new set rather than taking one as parameter\r\n - instead of making CacheWriter abstract, it would be cleaner to make the key extractor an interface and have the CacheWriter take an instance of that (i believe guava
