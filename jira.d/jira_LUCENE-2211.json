By the attribute, you can track wonderful, if save/restore and clearAttributes is correctly implemented. It also verifies that *before* a captureState() it was also cleared (as the state will also contain the clear call). Because if you consume tokens in a filter, capture the consumed tokens and insert them, the capturedStates must also be cleared before.\r\n\r\nIn contrib analyzers are some test that fail to pass this additional assertion.
