At least I thought I saw something like that when I looked through ES's docs a couple months ago.  I would like to add such an optimization within Lucene-spatial which would effectively avoid this particular issue you hit because it would end up being a simple Lucene term query.  This underlying issue would still exist though, it just wouldn't show up with a point query.\r\n\r\nIf you want a quick solution that only addresses intersection with a Point query, then you could modify the code I reference in the comment above to not use cell.getCenter() when queryShape is an instance of Point.  Make sense?\r\n\r\nTo be clear though, the quick solution or a solution optimizing a point query doesn't actually address the underlying problem; it just fixes it for point queries only.  It's still possible to index a point that fits inside a query rectangle extremely close to the edge, and depending on which side of the grid line the rectangle border is, you might not match the point.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dsmiley","name":"dsmiley","emailAddress":"dsmiley at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dsmiley&avatarId=10110"},"displayName":"David Smiley","active":true},"created":"2013-10-04T19:15:47.045+0000","updated":"2013-10-04T19:15:47.045+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646073/comment/13799375","id":"13799375","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=olimcc","name":"olimcc","emailAddress":"dev at olimcc dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"oli mcc","active":true},"body":"Hi David,\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay in following up, I've actually been spending some time familiarizing myself with the code and have some followup thoughts/questions.\r\n\r\nI think I get the issue now; the optimization short circuits to using the centre (a cheaper relation verification) in some cases, and as a result, the following two query types (a point and polygon) would not match due to no intersection with the centre.\r\n!https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iEX4D7PXQHq3mJvSII-Y0Y5MHPKSGOkqjUV6UcIecY4/pub?w=759&h=353!\r\n\r\n- It's not clear to me why the quick fix doesn't work in both cases you described however, maybe  I'm missing the underlying problem.
