That was my experience when I upgraded my dev server to the released 4.6.0, rebuilt the index (resulting in seven core swaps), and then later restarted Solr for some config changes.  It's not standard procedure to restart Solr after rebuilding, but it does occasionally happen.  It happens a LOT on my dev server, where I try out new configs.\r\n\r\nIf I were to do a PERSIST CoreAdmin action after each swap, would it effectively fix the problem even on an unpatched 4.6.0?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I do have the ability to instead do a \"persist all\" after all of the swaps, because I separately create and track per-server objects for CoreAdmin SolrJ calls.  Although I end up with 28 HttpSolrServer objects for updates and queries with my production build application, I only create one CoreAdmin server object for each host/port combination, instead of an additional 28 objects.  I don't know what the incremental size of HttpSolrServer objects is, but I do try to be careful about memory.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=elyograg","name":"elyograg","emailAddress":"apache at elyograg dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749"},"displayName":"Shawn Heisey","active":true},"created":"2013-12-18T03:49:44.997+0000","updated":"2013-12-18T03:49:44.997+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12683781/comment/13867142","id":"13867142","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=elyograg","name":"elyograg","emailAddress":"apache at elyograg dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=elyograg&avatarId=20749"},"displayName":"Shawn Heisey","active":true},"body":"With a verbal OK from [~markrmiller@gmail.com] via IRC, I am backporting the fix for this issue to 4.6.1.\r\n\r\nBoth precommit and tests in solr/ are passing.
