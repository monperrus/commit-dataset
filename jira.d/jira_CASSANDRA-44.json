We could do it like this:\r\n\r\n - on startup, a cassandra node must contact zookeeper and read the column family data.  this is the only time it will abort if ZK is not available.\r\n - when an operation is requested for a columnfamily that does not exist, the node checks zookeeper to see if that column has been added\r\n - additionally, we can check every hour or so for new columns and removed columns.  so removed CFs could accept ops for a while after officially being \"removed.\" \r\n - adding and removing CFs would be done with a web interface.  (I'm strongly in favor of moving the web UI to Jython; it's much better suited for this than raw Java.)\r\n\r\nAt the znode level, we would have /columfamilies/[tablename]/[columnfamily1|columnfamily2|...] where the columnfamily znodes contain the sort information and any other attributes that was previously being stored in TableMetadata.\r\n\r\nNotes to keep adminning a ZK ensemble relatively painless:\r\n\r\n - use the Cassandra seed nodes as the ZK ensemble members.  (Both seed nodes and ZK require a relatively small number of machines in the cluster to participate.)  We can ship a config file so that cassandra will continue to Just Work on localhost.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-04-08T21:10:40.652+0000","updated":"2009-04-08T21:10:40.652+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12421826/comment/12697530","id":"12697530","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"Brett pointed out on IRC that we'd want to start the namespace with /cassandra/[clustername] to avoid collisions with other ZK users and cassandra clusters. \r\n\r\nHe also said that he will try to find time this week or next to work on this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-04-09T15:07:44.178+0000","updated":"2009-04-09T15:07:44.178+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12421826/comment/12709449","id":"12709449","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=junrao","name":"junrao","emailAddress":"junrao at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jun Rao","active":true},"body":"Changing CFs has implications on the logs.

Keeping things config-file based has two drawbacks:\r\n - it requires filesystem access for whoever is doing the update, which is problematic in some environments\r\n - it makes life difficult for systems building on top of cassandra that want to automate this (easy for a human to dsh scp from somewhere; possible, but painful, to integrate this into an automated system that is more than a one-off)\r\n - it requires either all nodes being up for the upgrade, which is simple but unrealistic, or ops manually re-pushing the update to nodes that are down, which is a pita\r\n\r\nSo if we can instead move to a system where KS/CF definitions are stored in a system CF and updated programatically, I think that would be best.\r\n\r\nPossible evolution of the code might look like\r\n (1) move KS/CF definitions into the system table\r\n (2) add schema change methods internally and tests (possibly expose via JMX for manual testing, but not nodeprobe)\r\n (3) add thrift interface to send schema changes out to other nodes\r\n (4) add gossip of MetadataVersion (a user provided? automatically generated? identifier string): gossip automatically handles updating nodes that were down on what happened while they were out.  Full schema will not fit in gossip but a version id will.  A node whose internal MV is lower than one it sees in gossip, should ask the node w/ the higher version to send it the new version.  (Remember we cannot rely on HH for this since the FD may not have recognized that the node was down when the update was happening).\r\n\r\nWe punt completely on two clients requesting conflicting changes from different coordinator nodes.  \"Don't do that.\"  (Just as copying out two conflicting config files is Bad.)\r\n\r\nOne possible layout for the metadata CFs:\r\n\r\nmigrations: hardcoded key of \"migrations\": each column w/ name of MetadataVersion contains the op performed\r\n\r\nschema: key of MV, supercolumns of KS, columns of serialized CF definitions\r\n\r\nso on startup, we read latest MV from migrations row, then the associated schema.\r\n\r\n(Looked at this way it seems like we should just have MV be a TimeUUID and not make client deal w/ that.)\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-12-22T17:24:53.628+0000","updated":"2009-12-22T17:24:53.628+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12421826/comment/12796860","id":"12796860","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"Instead of manually propagating & reconciling schema changes in (3) and (4), we could add per-keyspace replication factor as suggested in CASSANDRA-620.

I'm trying to think of a way that having a ZK ensemble would give us a magic wand here, as originally envisioned, but I don't see one (short of having nodes ask ZK for schema definitions on every op, which is unacceptable for performance).
