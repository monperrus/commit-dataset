Other than that it's just relying on libraries and you get to run pig scripts or the pig shell - no other java programming needed.  So for that, it's either that we need to use the configuration file for cassandra that's already there - based on the static initialization of the vars in DatabaseDescriptor, or we have to create a mechanism to configure it.\r\n\r\nDoes that make more sense?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeromatron","name":"jeromatron","emailAddress":"jeremy dot hanna1234 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeremy Hanna","active":true},"created":"2010-06-11T15:55:37.716+0000","updated":"2010-06-11T15:57:37.999+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12463607/comment/12877842","id":"12877842","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeromatron","name":"jeromatron","emailAddress":"jeremy dot hanna1234 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeremy Hanna","active":true},"body":"I wonder if there could be some way to just have the subset of configuration information that it needs in a cassandra.yaml file.
