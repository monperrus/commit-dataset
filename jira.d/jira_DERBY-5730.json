That is, I commented out the\r\nfollowing line in DataDictionaryImpl.getRoutineList():\r\n\r\n          DataDictionaryImpl.SYSFUN_AD[f] = ad;\r\n\r\nThe variant that didn't cache the alias descriptor, executed the\r\nstatement 2.5% slower on average in my environment.\r\n\r\nSince this degradation will only be observed when SYSFUN functions are\r\ncompiled for the first time in newly booted databases, I'd say it's\r\nnegligible.\r\n\r\nOne might perhaps even say that the gains of the alias descriptor\r\ncache are so small that they don't justify the extra memory and code\r\ncomplexity, but I don't think we want to go there in this JIRA.\r\n\r\n> If there were no memory consequences does the existing\r\n> implementation have any correctness issues?\r\n\r\nNot that I have been able to find. The data dictionary instance is\r\nonly used in the following situations, as far as I can tell:\r\n\r\n- At initialization time of the AliasDescriptor to find the UUID of\r\n  the SYSFUN schema. This doesn't cause any problems, since the data\r\n  dictionary instance is still alive at that time, and the UUID of the\r\n  SYSFUN schema is the same in all databases.\r\n\r\n- When an alias is dropped, but the functions in SYSFUN can't be\r\n  dropped.\r\n\r\n- During invalidation, but SYSFUN functions can't be invalidated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-05-07T12:15:08.644+0000","updated":"2012-05-07T12:15:08.644+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12553108/comment/13269566","id":"13269566","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Attaching the program I used to test the performance impact.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-05-07T12:31:19.069+0000","updated":"2012-05-07T12:31:19.069+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12553108/comment/13270373","id":"13270373","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 1335423.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-05-08T11:30:21.015+0000","updated":"2012-05-08T11:30:21.015+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12553108/comment/13709172","id":"13709172","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mamtas","name":"mamtas","emailAddress":"msatoor at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mamta A.
