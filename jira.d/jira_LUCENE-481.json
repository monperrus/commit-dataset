\"java.io.FileNotFoundException: ...\\segments (The system cannot find the file specified)\" once every few days....\r\n\r\nThis is because the new segments data is first written to the file \"segments.new\" which is then renamed to \"segments\".\r\nThe javadoc for Directory says renameTo() should be atomic, but the current implementation in FSDirectory isn't.\r\nIf the searcher happens to try to read the segments file in the (admittedly very small) time between the \"nu.delete()\" and the \"old.renameTo(nu)\" it gets the
