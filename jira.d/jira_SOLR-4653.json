What you say makes sense but the common practice seems to be that:\r\n* people modify the example's configuration files and overwrite them just because all the paths are relative from those directories and pointing at contribs,\r\n* when you want to create an isolate configuration and pass it to somebody to, say, run with -Dsolr.solr.home it's hard because you need to know absolute installation paths or make the user install that configuration in an exact folder under solr's unpacked structure.

That's my understanding of the code, didn't check on a live instance. So if you passed ${solr.contrib.root} and it doesn't point anywhere you'd get a warning in the logs.\r\n\r\nSince some folks expressed their concern about failing hard (and it was actually documented that it won't fail hard) I think it makes sense to preserve this behavior, at least in the same Solr line (4.x). Perhaps another issue changing this behavior should be filed for 5.x.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"created":"2013-04-03T06:38:27.952+0000","updated":"2013-04-03T06:38:27.952+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639780/comment/13653925","id":"13653925","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Closed after release.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2013-05-10T10:33:26.198+0000","updated":"2013-05-10T10:33:26.198+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-4653/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1j98n:"}}
