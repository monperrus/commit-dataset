Instead of using \"file://url\" which causes FTP handler to be used, these tests could use \"file:///url\". Blueprint would then search for nonexistent file in the local filesystem. The result would be the same, but network env would not be used at all.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n  Bartek","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bartosz","name":"bartosz","emailAddress":"Kowalewski dot Bartosz at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bartosz Kowalewski","active":true},"created":"2010-06-06T10:00:06.123+0000","updated":"2010-06-06T10:00:06.123+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12466282/comment/12876032","id":"12876032","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahrwald","name":"mahrwald","emailAddress":"vmahrwald at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Valentin Mahrwald","active":true},"body":"Hi Bartek,\r\n\r\nthanks for the suggestion, works like a charm.\r\n\r\nMy initial experiments were something like \"file://some/non/existent/url\", which also fails fast.
