(To make it possible to have the new logic that releases the resources at just one location.)\r\n\r\n- Make the tearDown() method in the decorator returned by DatabasePropertyTestSetup.getNoTeardownInstance() close and null out the default connection.\r\n\r\nThese changes preserve the main purpose of these decorators, which is that they shouldn't reset the properties in tearDown(), and at the same time allows the connection and its resources to be garbage collected once they're no longer used.\r\n\r\nsuites.All ran successfully with the patch.\r\n\r\nI also verified that the patch reduced the number of BasicDatabase instances still held on the heap after running RolesTest and DboPowersTest. The numbers were reduced from 8 to 4, and from 50 to 36, respectively. (I had expected that the numbers would go down to one or two (wombat + dbsqlauth), so there may still be some other related bugs.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-04-24T09:23:50.310+0000","updated":"2012-04-24T09:23:50.310+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12552270/comment/13261451","id":"13261451","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 1330196.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2012-04-25T11:20:07.529+0000","updated":"2012-04-25T11:20:07.529+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-5705/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06hmn:"}}
