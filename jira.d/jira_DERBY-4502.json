This fixes the problem. I am running regression tests now.\r\n\r\nThe quick fix is to give the dummy permissions descriptor a dummy UUID, viz., the UUID of the system table. A more elaborate fix would be to allocate a new set of UUIDs, one for each system table, and use those UUIDs instead. The more elaborate fix would be useful if we ever wanted to regard UUIDs as self-describing object IDs, capable of reconstructing the objects they identify. However, that is not how we use UUIDs today. Today, looking up an object involves knowing both its UUID and the object's type (e.g., table, index, constraint, function, procedure, trigger, etc..). With this fix, we maintain the current contract: UUIDs are unique within a given type namespace.\r\n\r\nMigrating to the more elaborate scheme should be possible if we decide later on that we want UUIDs to be self-describing.\r\n\r\nIn writing the regression test for this problem, I tripped across another bug: After a reboot, the system SchemaDescriptors have a null authorization id. I fixed this problem by poking the correct authorization id into the system SchemaDescriptors during database reboot.\r\n\r\nTouches the following files:\r\n\r\nM      java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/PermissionsCacheable.java\r\n\r\nThis is the fix to the bug described by this JIRA.
