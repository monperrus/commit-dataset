Walk the call stack until the invoker is found. The invoker can be the caller of the InitialContext class constructor or the NamingManager or DirectoryManager getObjectInstance methods.\r\n• Get the class loader of the caller and see if it, or an ancestor, implements the BundleReference interface.\r\n• If a Class Loader implementing the BundleReference interface is found call the getBundle method to get the clients Bundle; then call the getBundleContext method on the Bundle to get the clients Bundle Context.\r\n• If the Bundle Context has been found stop, else continue with the next stack frame.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation only the first two bullet points are implemented, the third one is missing.
