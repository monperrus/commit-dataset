This constant needs to stay at 26 to ensure that newer\r\nservers can talk to old clients after the DERBY-2602 changes. It is\r\nnot used by any of the meta-data calls, as far as I know, so I think\r\nit is safe to leave this change out. You may want to run the\r\ncompatibility tests to verify that we don't break compatibility. See\r\njava/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/junitTests/compatibility/README.html\r\nfor details on how to set up and run these tests.\r\n\r\n2) We have this code in ColumnMetaData.getScale():\r\n\r\n    // We get the scale from the SQLDA as returned by DERBY, but DERBY does not return the ANSI-defined\r\n    // value of scale 6 for TIMESTAMP.\r\n    //\r\n    //   The JDBC drivers should hardcode this info as a short/near term solution.\r\n    //\r\n    if (types_[column - 1] == Types.TIMESTAMP) {\r\n        return 6;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return sqlScale_[column - 1];\r\n\r\nThe patch changes this code to return 9 in the case of a timestamp,\r\nwhich I think is fine, but I'm wondering if the special case for\r\ntimestamp could be removed now that we make the embedded driver return\r\n9 from its getScale() method. I think the value in sqlScale_[column-1]\r\ncomes from the embedded driver, but we need to check that.\r\n\r\n3) I see that the existing tests have been updated, and those changes\r\nlook fine to me. But do we also need new test cases to cover all the\r\nchanges listed in the functional spec? I see that the existing tests\r\ncover these methods with the timestamp type:\r\n\r\n    DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo()\r\n    DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns()\r\n    DatabaseMetaData.getFunctionColumns()\r\n    ResultSetMetaData.getColumnDisplaySize()\r\n    ResultSetMetaData.getPrecision()\r\n    ResultSetMetaData.getScale()\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't find that we test ParameterMetaData.getPrecision() and\r\nParameterMetaData.getScale() with timestamp anywhere. Do you think it\r\nwould be worthwhile to add tests for those two methods?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-09-02T11:38:44.110+0000","updated":"2010-09-02T11:38:44.110+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461979/comment/12905483","id":"12905483","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"I ran the regression tests with the patch, and these three tests failed for me in derbyall:\r\n\r\nderbyall/derbyall.fail:lang/compressTable.sql\r\nderbyall/derbyall.fail:lang/specjPlans.sql\r\nderbyall/derbyall.fail:lang/triggerRefClause.sql\r\n\r\nIt looks like all failures were caused by ij giving more space to timestamp columns, so we just need to update the master files.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2010-09-02T11:49:28.610+0000","updated":"2010-09-02T11:49:28.610+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461979/comment/12905509","id":"12905509","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nirmal","name":"nirmal","emailAddress":"nirmal070125 at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nirmal&avatarId=17689"},"displayName":"Nirmal Fernando","active":true},"body":"Hi Knut,\r\n\r\nRegarding your first comment, when I remove those changes earlier I got some test failures in DateTimeTest.
