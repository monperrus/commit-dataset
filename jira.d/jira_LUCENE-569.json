Elschot","active":true},"body":"Hoss,\r\n\r\nI'm afraid you've uncovered a bug in NearSpans.java for the ordered case.\r\nThe test case testNearSpansSkipToLikeNext() uses this test data:\r\ndoc 0: w1 w2 w3 .. ..\r\ndoc 1: w1 w3 w2 w3 ..\r\nand an ordered SpanNearQuery with slop 1 for \"w1 w2 w3\" should match doc 0 and doc 1\r\nThe test first does a skipTo(0) on the NearSpans which succeeds to match doc 0.\r\nThen it tries skipTo(1) on the NearSpans, which should succeed, but fails, because\r\nNearSpans first does skipTo(1) on the Spans for the query terms,\r\nwhich puts these term spans at\r\ndoc 1: w1 w3 w2\r\n(as expected) but this does not match because it's not ordered.\r\nThe NearSpans then tries a next() on itself, which starts by doing next() on the term spans\r\nfor w1 in NearSpans.java near line 146:\r\n      more = min().next();                        // trigger further scanning\r\nHowever, in the ordered case, it should have advanced the first non ordered term,\r\nhere w3, and so it misses the match:\r\ndoc 1: w1 .. w2 w3 ..\r\n\r\nI would recommend to use the alternative NearSpans from LUCENE 413 mentioned above\r\nto fix this. The NearSpansOrdered there differs from the current version in that it does not\r\nmatch overlapping subspans, but it passes all current test cases including TestNearSpans here.\r\nOverlaps between Spans can occur when SpanNearQueries are nested and/or when multiple\r\nterms are indexed on the same position.\r\nIn case this ordered non overlapping matching becomes an issue, it can always be fixed later.\r\nThe NearSpansUnordered there is just like the current NearSpans, only simplified, and this\r\nmatches overlapping subspans.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl","name":"paul.elschot@xs4all.nl","emailAddress":"paul dot j dot elschot at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=paul.elschot%40xs4all.nl&avatarId=23180"},"displayName":"Paul Elschot","active":true},"created":"2006-05-14T03:51:10.000+0000","updated":"2006-05-14T03:51:10.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12334196/comment/12402471","id":"12402471","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"\r\nI tried to make sense of the existing NearSpans implimentation over the weekend ... i did not succeed.
