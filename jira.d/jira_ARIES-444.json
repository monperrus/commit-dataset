The default local platform service cannot be excluded when an application server consumes the application bundles.\r\nAt the moment, the default local platform service is registered by the bundle of application utils. An application server normally wishes to supply their own platform service. If we don't separate this service from the application utils bundle, the default service will make its way to an application server's service registry. It will be wired to Aries Application manager bundle before the good dedicated local platform service becomes available. This will cause unpredictable behaviour.\r\n\r\n2. In application itests, we need to get rid of the hack, blocking one bundle from starting until another bundle has started, because a real fix has been delivered for the the problem of the hack tring to solve.
