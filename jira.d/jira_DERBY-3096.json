So when I found that this feature works when the client is run with IBM J9 VM 1.5 independent of which platform the server runs on, and fails when the client is run with any Sun VM (tried 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6) independent of the platform the server is run on, I suspect this to be a bug in the Sun JSSE implementation.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to either Sun VM with IBM (or possibly other) JSSE or another VM altogether. I have not tested this with other VM's than Sun and IBM.\r\n\r\nI will pursue this further with a Derby-independent repro and send my findings to the proper channels. I'll also try to figure out a workaround in the Derby code to facilitate Sun VM use.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bernt","name":"bernt","emailAddress":"bernt at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernt M.
