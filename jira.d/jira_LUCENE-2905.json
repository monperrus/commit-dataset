Fixed Int Block codecs like PFOR and BulkVint just read their single numBytes header they already have today, and skip numBytes.\r\n\r\nIsn't our skipInterval too low? Most of our codecs are using block sizes such as 64 or 128, so a skipInterval of 16 seems a little overkill.\r\n\r\nShouldn't skipInterval not even be a final constant in SegmentWriteState, but instead completely private to the codec?\r\n\r\nFor block codecs, doesn't it make sense for them to only support skipping to the start of a block? Then, their skip pointers dont need to be a combination of delta + upto, because upto is always zero. What would we have to modify in the bulkpostings api for jump() to work with this?\r\n\r\nFor block codecs, shouldn't skipInterval then be some sort of divisor, based on block size (maybe by default its 1, meaning we can skip to the start of a every block)\r\n\r\nFor codecs like Simple64 that encode fixed length frames, shouldnt we use 'blockid' instead of file pointer so that we get smaller numbers? e.g. simple64 can do blockid * 8 to get to the file pointer.\r\n\r\nGoing along with the blockid concept, couldnt pointers in the terms dict be blockid deltas from the index term, instead of fp deltas?

Delbru","active":true},"body":"Hi Robert,\r\n\r\nit is good to see we are going in the same direction ;o). Here is a short paper about an extension of skip list for block based inverted file [1] which was accepted at the European Conference of Information Retrieval. I shared this paper in a previous discussion with Michael. Maybe you will find some ideas inside that are worth keeping in mind.\r\n\r\nAlso, the main problem of the current skip list implementation when it is applied on Sep codec is in my opinion the fact that we have to store for each skip list entry the fp of each of the sep file. And more you have files (in the SIREn case, we had 5 files), more the skip list data structure get bigger.\r\nHowever, if you think of it, the main goal of the skip list is to skip doc id, not freq or pos. We are storing the fps of the freq and pos files only because we need to synchronise the position of the \"inverted file pointer\" on each file. \r\nAlso, this occurs some overhead when you only need to answer\r\n- pure boolean query: we only need to scan the doc file, but we are still reading and decoding the fp pointers of the freq and pos file;\r\n- extended boolean query: we only need to scan the doc and freq file, but we are still reading and decoding the fp pointers of the pos file;\r\n\r\nAn idea I had a few months ago (but never found the time to implement it and test it) was to change the way the skip list data structure is created. The idea was to store the pointer to the doc file in the skip entry, and nothing else. The other pointers (to the freq file and position file) are in fact stored into the block header.\r\nWhen using the skip list, you will traverse the skip list until you find the skip point of interest, then decode the associated skip entry and get the doc file pointer. The doc file pointer indicates the beginning of the block that contains the identifiers that you are looking for.\r\nAfter reading the block from the disk and load it into memory, you can decode its header, which contains a pointer to the associated block into the frequency file. Similarly, into the block header of the frequency file, you have a pointer to the associated block into the pos file. In fact, you can picture this by a linked list of block. The skip list provides only the first pointer to the block doc file, then pointers to subsequent blocks are included into the block headers.\r\nOn one hand, this considerably reduce the size of the skip list, since most of the information are \"exported\" and encoded into block headers. On the other hand, I am not sure if it reduces the size of the index, as it just move the data from the skip list to the inverted file. In addition, I think it makes impossible the delta-encoding of the fp for the freq and pos file. But they might be other optimisation possible with this data model.\r\n\r\n[1] http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1278798/ecir2011-skipblock.pdf","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=renaud.delbru","name":"renaud.delbru","emailAddress":"renaud dot delbru at deri dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Renaud Delbru","active":true},"created":"2011-02-04T17:52:42.489+0000","updated":"2011-02-04T17:53:00.404+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497700/comment/12990654","id":"12990654","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"These are all great ideas!\r\n\r\nInterleaving frq/doc makes tons of sense, not only for better\r\ncompression, but because for large (can't-be-hot) indexes the need to\r\nseek to 2 files during search is costly.\r\n\r\nIf we are _REALLY_ sure keeping int alignment in these intblock\r\nencoded files is not important (ie, we really do get best perf by\r\nslurping in byte[] and then decoding from there), then we should also\r\nstore eg skip data into the frq/doc file (this is what Standard\r\ndoes).\r\n\r\nMaybe similarly interleave payload/positions packets?\r\n\r\nI think our skipInterval is too low for the block codecs (and, should\r\nbe private) Separately, I think we should break out \"when skip is even\r\nstored\" vs \"how frequently we index skip data\".

But when i started trying to draw\r\nthis up, I came to the conclusion that payload byte[]s should themselves\r\nbe actual terms (e.g. deduplicated), and we store some sort of ord to get\r\nto them instead of bytes and length, etc. if they were themselves terms,\r\nthen they could also store forward postings back to their docs, and you \r\ncould query on payloads (attributes) efficiently too... but I know this\r\nwould be a fairly large change.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nSeparately, I think we should break out \"when skip is even\r\nstored\" vs \"how frequently we index skip data\".\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI agree, another reason to pull skipInterval completely codec-private.\r\nThen a codec could itself have a separate \"skipMinimum\" too.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nFor low DF terms w/in a block I think we shouldn't store their\r\npointers into the posting; instead, you should load an earlier term's\r\npostings and scan over its postings. This should save tons of space\r\nin the tib file.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nHow would this work? Isnt everything right now in the .tib delta-encoded\r\nagainst the index term? What if there are 'large' terms in between?\r\nAnd for some queries like rangequery, wouldnt this create a little O(n^2)\r\nof sorts? I don't think this is a big deal, most people should be using\r\ne.g. NumericRangeQuery, and maybe we could still prevent it...?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"created":"2011-02-04T18:16:53.650+0000","updated":"2011-02-11T11:58:21.061+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497700/comment/12993205","id":"12993205","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rcmuir&avatarId=10150"},"displayName":"Robert Muir","active":true},"body":"here's a patch with what Mike suggested, moving the skipping stuff private to the codecs, and separating the interval from the minimum df necessary to index skip data.\r\n\r\ni also added the 'dont skip when close' opto to Sep and Preflex codecs (since i neglected to do this and only did Standard).\r\n\r\nI kept all parameters the same (I think we should benchmark etc before changing) but I did some experiments with a fairly large skipMinimum and it looked promising.

So they work in lock-step, on the same actual underlying index input (sharing io buffer, etc).\r\n\r\npointers in the term dictionary and skipdata are reduced, because they only point to the block/offset in the single .doc file, and the freq is implied and parallel following it.\r\n\r\ni added skipBlock() which for these fixed encoders, means they only read their header (typically a single vint) and skip their compressed payload. Because of this, i increased skip interval (to blocksize actually) in the patch. \r\n\r\nThis might seem scary, but its not so bad, because without using any skip data, we can skip over the blocks themselves... e.g. skipping over 16,384 pending positions is only 128 vint reads.\r\n\r\nfor now, i only cutover BulkVInt for testing, here's what i have so far:\r\nThe total index size for the
