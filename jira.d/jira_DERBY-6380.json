I think this approach will be really helpful to debug any test fixture failures in ErrorStreamTest. \r\n\r\nBut if in future we added a new rolling file test in a different test other than ErrorStreamTest, then they will need to make similar changes in that test to copy the log files in case of failure(similar to the patch). Or if someone decided to run the bigger junit suite with rolling files, the failures in that scenario will not have the log files copied in the failed directory. May be we do not anticipate many people doing a task of running junit suite with rolling files and hence may be we do not need to worry about that scenario but I just wanted to share those unique cases here if we want to handle those.

So I ran the experiment, i.e. run all of suites.All with -Dderby.stream.error.style=rollingFile.\r\nI got one derby.log in the main test directory, and one under system. Neither were empty.\r\nI got only 3 test failures:\r\n- DerbyNetAutoStart.testStartNetworkServerLogMessageOnDualStart\r\n- lang.SysDiagVTIMappingTest.test_5391 (1x emb, 1x net).\r\nAnd indeed, the first actually check for derby.log, and the other sets derby.stream.error.file to test expects a specific name which setting is (as documented) overwritten by the style property. So these I think are understandable.\r\n\r\nBut I think there are other 'failures', because I see a lot of output going to the console, which I think happens when there's something wrong in creating the errorlog file?\r\nThe first seems to happen in \r\n(emb)store.ClassLoaderBootTest.tesBootingAnAlreadyBootedDatabase \r\nand\r\n(emb)store.ClassLoaderBootTes.testBootingDatabaseShutdownByAnotherCLR\r\nThere seems to be nothing specific to derby.log in these last two tests - so I do not understand that behavior.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect that I noticed with this experiment is that the replication tests database directories which are always left behind after running the replication tests (db_master and db_slave) both have a derby.log file, so perhaps either the tests, or perhaps replication itself does not, or not correctly, work with the stream.error.style setting.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I do see a derby-0.log.lck, which I cannot find documented. Does anyone know where this comes from?\r\n\r\nIn another run (in a different directory) I even got a derby-0.log.1 and derby-0.log.1.lck file created.\r\n\r\nOn the whole though I think running all the tests with this setting is not very useful or interesting. I can see that running suites.All with specific properties is a valid/useful test because it forces all tests through the new code path. But in this case, I really don't think such a run is something we'd be interested in doing more than once, and so I think making specific code in the framework to capture this possibility is overkill.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2013-11-22T06:17:42.215+0000","updated":"2013-11-22T06:17:42.215+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674166/comment/13829726","id":"13829726","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"I forgot to say, that, if another test creates files that need to be saved to the fail directory, the test needs to make a similar adjustment as I did.

It probably does, a little, because it tries to copy 10 files that might not exist, for each test run. \r\n\r\nSo, is this something we want to do or should I only commit the ErrorStreamTest improvement (probably will create a separate issue for it) and mark this particular issue as 'Won't fix'?\r\n\r\nYet another approach is that I could make the change to BaseTestCase dependent on whether the property derby.stream.error.style is set to 'rollingFile'. But it still seems a global change for an unlikely run scenario to me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"created":"2013-11-22T06:55:08.937+0000","updated":"2013-11-22T06:55:08.937+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674166/comment/13833505","id":"13833505","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"body":"Commit 1545935 from [~myrna] in branch 'code/trunk'\r\n[ https://svn.apache.org/r1545935 ]\r\n\r\nDERBY-6380; Rolling log files do not get copied in failed directory when a junit test fails\r\n   adjusting ErrorStreamTest to copy files created in it on fail, and BaseTestCase to copy defaults on fail.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","emailAddress":"no-reply at urd dot zones dot apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true},"created":"2013-11-27T06:14:27.318+0000","updated":"2013-11-27T06:14:27.318+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674166/comment/13833511","id":"13833511","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=myrna","name":"myrna","emailAddress":"m dot v dot lunteren at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Myrna van Lunteren","active":true},"body":"I ran suites.All with and without my patch, and the run without was about 20 seconds faster (over 3 1/2 hours), which I think is not significant.
