This patch raises a SQLWarning if you attempt to change the encryption on an already booted database. The warning tells you that the encryption state was not changed and that you need to shutdown the database before attempting the operation. Tests passed cleanly for me.\r\n\r\nA warning is now raised if you set one of the following attributes while connecting to an already booted database:\r\n\r\n  dataEncryption\r\n  newBootPassword\r\n  newEncryptionKey\r\n  decryptDatabase\r\n\r\n\r\nMy original plan was to raise an exception in these situations. The Reference Manual is quite clear that dataEncryption=true is supposed to be used to change the encryption state of a database. However, I decided that some applications may set dataEncryption=true every time that they connect to an encrypted database--in previous releases that attribute has been treated as a NOP if the database is already booted. So I downgraded the exception to a warning. I suppose that we could still raise an exception for the other attributes (I don't imagine anyone sets those attributes unless they really mean to change the encryption state of the database). But it seemed cleaner to me to have one SQLState for this condition and to treat all of the cases the same way.\r\n\r\nAfter committing this patch, we will want to modify the user guides to clarify the following point:\r\n\r\no If you are changing the encryption state of the database, be sure to check for SQLWarnings after the change. The change succeeded only if there were no SQLWarnings or SQLExceptions.\r\n\r\nWe should probably add a release note too just in case applications are checking for SQLWarnings after connecting to an already booted database with dataEncryption=true.\r\n\r\nTouches the following files:\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nM       java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedConnection.java\r\nM
