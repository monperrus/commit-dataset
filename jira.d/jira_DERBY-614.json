In this case, the app wants to stop reading the data early, so instead of sending a CNTQRY the client ends up sending a CLSQRY.  The CLSQRY codepoint is read, but then parseCNTQRY() is called, so the server is looking for CNTQRY data (which expects a BLKSZ) and instead gets CLSQRY data (which has no BLKSZ), hence the missingCodePoint exception.\r\n\r\nI looked at the DDM Manual and found the following statements:\r\n\r\n[ LMTBLKPRC ]: A query is terminated any time the CLSQRY command suspends it.\r\n\r\n[ EXCSQLSTT ]: After the EXCSQLSTT or each subsequent CNTQRY command, each result set is suspended\r\nunless some condition terminates the result set (see CNTQRY (on page 234)).

The application server returns one or more QRYDTAs with the rows it has fetched, and expects the CNTQRY request from the application request either to complete the DRDA rowset (or, optionally) to reset it.\"\r\n- Volume 3 says that the MAXBLKEXT value defaults to 0, which I think means that, by default, the server can only return a single QRYDTA block at a time.\r\n- On page 137 of volume 1: \"Note: At any time after the application requester has sent the OPNQRY command and the application server has successfully processed it, and before the application server has sent an ENDQRYRM reply message, the application requester can send a Close Query (CLSQRY) command...\"\r\n- On page 435 of volume 1: \"If the space remaining in the query block cannot contain the complete base rows, only that part of the\r\nrow data that can fit in the remainder of the exact query block is added to the query block.

They are pretty hard.  That's why I am making you do the research #:)  This research by the way is excellent.\r\n\r\nDSS stands for Data Stream Structure.  It is sort of the packaging mechanism for data going to the client. It's size is limitted to 32K but sometimes it is ok to set a flag to continue in the next DSS and send more data.    The Data Stream Structure documented in the DDM manual under DSS.

For instance if you change your repro to execute some totally unrelated statement before closing the result set, such as \"CREATE TABLE FOO (i int)\" then before it ever sends the CLSQRY for this result set you will see an EXCSQLIMM  as the next command sent from the client.    So, we would again fall over if we simply changied splitQRYDTA to handle CLSQRY as well as CNTQRY.  Also we may get an intervening CNTQRY for an entirely different result set and then we could end up sending the data for the wrong result set for the reqest, so that is why I think the parseCNTQRY in splitQRYDTA is wrong. \r\n\r\nCould you try  to change your test case as described and see if in fact my assessment is correct that we might get some other request from the client before we get the CNTQRY or CLSQRY request for this result set?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2005-10-25T22:51:55.000+0000","updated":"2005-10-25T22:51:55.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317791/comment/12355871","id":"12355871","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"> Could you try to change your test case and see if we might get some other request from the client before we get the CNTQRY or CLSQRY request for this result set?\r\n\r\nIt is exactly as you suspected. If I add a 2nd statement and call 's2.executeUpdate(\"create table foo (i int)\");' at the critical time, we still get the SYNTAXRM exception, but the details are indeed different:\r\n - the codepoint in the exception in the server log is 0x2105, which I think is RDBCMTOK\r\n - the server-side trace shows that we got EXCSQLIMM rather than CLSQRY:\r\n         RECEIVE BUFFER: EXCSQLIMM           (ASCII)           (EBCDIC)\r\n- the server-side stack trace is just slightly different. Rather than parseCNTQRY calling 'missingCodePoint', which is what happens when we send a CLSQRY, this time parseCNTQRY calls 'invalidCodePoint', which throws the SYNTAXRM exception.\r\n\r\nSo I agree with you: the client should be able to send *any* command at this point, so the server needs to be prepared to\r\nhandle any command. I guess this means that the server needs to be able to fully suspend this query, holding the partial row in abeyance, such that it can resume processing the query, starting a new QRYDTA block with the remainder of this partial row, if the client so requests, but also be able to handle any other command that might arrive.\r\n\r\nI see that there is DRDAStatement.rsSuspend, which in turn calls DRDAResultSet.suspend, but those seem to simply set a status flag; we also need to record the contents of local variable 'temp' which is holding the remainder of the partially-returned row, yes?\r\n\r\nIt seems that a solution should be something along the lines of:\r\n1) when splitQRYDTA determines that it cannot fit all the data into this block, it should attach the remainder data to the result set, suspend the statement, and pop all the way back out to the processCommands loop\r\n2) When a CNTQRY is received, the first thing that writeQRYDTA should do is to look for any partial remainder data that might have been saved by step 1, and write that data prior to writing any new data. \r\n3) And it seems like the MAXBLKEXT parameter should figure in here as well, I think?\r\n\r\nIt's still muddy, but it's getting much clearer.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2005-10-26T01:08:47.000+0000","updated":"2005-10-26T01:08:47.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317791/comment/12355877","id":"12355877","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Your steps 1 and 2 sound like a good approach to me.

We'll need to ensure the remainder data attached to the resultset is released/freed if the CLSQRY DDM command is sent by the requester or due to some unexpected error condition (as part of ENDQRYRM) returned from the server - but that should happen as part of resultset deallocation logic.. \r\n\r\nAs far as handling MAXBLKEXT in 3) - I'd say that we obviously need to take it into account since a client (requester) could set a value different than zero (i.e. other DRDA clients out there).\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, the DDM specifications mention the following for MAXBLKEXT:\r\n\r\n\"A value of zero indicates that the requester is not capable of receiving extra query blocks of answer set data. \"\r\n\r\nwhich is the default we have right now, hence the server should not be returning extra query blocks of QRYDTA...would that also be why the client sent CLSQRY in the first place...I mean, if the client set a MAXBLKEXT of zero, then it will not expect reading further data from the server after the initial reply (just some thoughts).\r\n\r\nNow, the specs also say the following about MAXBLKEXT:\r\n\r\n\"A value of minus one indicates that the requester is capable of receiving the entire result set.\"  (am reading this as the requester will be able to receive the entire resultset without any particular limit on the number of blocks of answer set data returned by the server) - this is not very clear from the specs so not completely sure about this. \r\n\r\nHence, should not we set '-1' as the default value of MAXBLKEXT for the Derby DRDA networkclient driver instead of zero? Since and IMHO, the (derby) server should by default try to return the entire resultset (in chunks/clocks as appropriate) to the derby networkclient which has control as far as reading more data or not (via CLSQRY) anyway.\r\n\r\nNow, in case of MAXBLKEXT limit being reached (or in MAXBLKEXT  value being zero) then the server should probably terminate the query via a ENDQRYRM reply and some error condition (Severity Code).\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=forsini","name":"forsini","emailAddress":"francois dot orsini at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Francois Orsini","active":true},"created":"2005-11-15T06:12:58.000+0000","updated":"2005-11-15T06:12:58.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317791/comment/12358300","id":"12358300","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Hi Kathey & Francois (& others):\r\n\r\nI'm trying to write up a mini-design spec for changes to the DRDA implementation to resolve this issue. But during my research, I've gotten myself pretty confused, and could use some help. Can you consider the following questions and tell me what you think?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance, bryan\r\n\r\n1) Does the LMTBLKPRC protocol apply to invocations of callable statements? That is, if we call a procedure, and it has output parameters, and the data in those parameters exceeds the blocksize, should we split the query data and await a CNTQRY?\r\n\r\n2) When we are returning externalized data as part of the response to a query, are there any rules for the intermingling of the EXTDTA objects and the QRYDTA objects? Suppose, for example, that a particular QRYDTA object contains the end of row 4, the entire contents of rows 5 and 6, and the start of row 7. I believe that the EXTDTA for rows 5 and 6 should be sent after we send this QRYDTA, but I am not sure about the EXTDTA for rows 4 and 7. I guess what I am asking is: is the rule \"we send the EXTDTA for a particular row after the QRYDTA which contains the *start* of this row\", or is the rule: \"we send the EXTDTA for a particular row after the QRYDTA which contains the *end* of this row\"?\r\n\r\n3) At the JDBC user level, what JDBC API calls cause the qryrtndta parameter to be set to FALSE. In the DRDA spec, I see: \"The qryrtndta parameter specifies whether data is to be returned with the command. If FALSE is sent on the command, the result is that only a positioning fetch operation is performed.\" How does this situation actually arise in ordinary use? What sort of client program would I write that would cause qryrtndta to be set to false?\r\n\r\n4) Do you think that we have any tests in the test suite which validate the behavior of the server when using both LMTBLKPRC protocol and QRYROWSET specification? I've been reading through the DRDA spec's discussion of QRYROWSET handling, and although it does provide some rules for how to handle the various combinations which arise, the rules are *extremely* complicated and I'm nervous about accidentally breaking this processing.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2005-11-23T05:40:35.000+0000","updated":"2005-11-23T05:40:35.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317791/comment/12358318","id":"12358318","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Well, this may be premature, or even wildly wrong, but I took a stab at designing a new implementation of the writeQRYDTA/writeFDODTA/splitQRYDTA methods in DRDAConnThread.java in order to fix this bug.

This means that the \"while\" loop in writeFDODTA usually runs exactly one time, and it is the responsibility of the \"while\" loop in writeQRYDTA to compose the implicit row set for return. I do think that it would be possible to push this behavior down into writeFDODTA and have a single \"while\" loop handle all these cases, but I also think that writeFDODTA is already complicated enough, so I chose instead to keep the current behavior, to be more surgical in my changes, and to document as best I could what is going on.\r\n\r\nSecond, test \"big.sql\" in the lang suite does a pretty good job of exposing a lot of the interesting behaviors of this part of the code.\r\n\r\nThird, as Kathey observed on the mailing list, the new member variable to hold the split data between client requests belongs on the DRDAResultSet, not on the DRDAStatement. I'm still not really sure I understand this business about a statement having multiple current result sets, but the implementation is much more natural with that change.\r\n\r\nFourth, it appears that the current code has the behavior that, when sending the remainder data for a split row in a subsequent QRYDTA block, no additional rows are added to an implicit result set for that QRYDTA block. Instead, the remainder data is placed into the QRYDTA block and immediately returned, and a subsequent CNTQRY/QRYDTA pair is needed to start fetching additional rows. This had completely escaped me during \"code reading\", but it is the whole point of the \"moreData=false\" after calling splitQRYDTA from writeFDODTA.\r\n\r\nFifth, with respect to EXTDTA and split query data, the behavior of the current code appears to be \"we send the EXTDTA for a particular row after the QRYDTA which contains the *end* of this row.\" I have tried to retain this behavior in the new code. One interesting case is when a row must be split across not just 2, but 3 QRYDTA blocks; in this case the EXTDTA needs to be sent after the 3rd such block; that is the reason for the extra \"if\" statement in writeQRYDTA.\r\n\r\nLastly, I'm still not sure I understand how LMTBLKPRC is supposed to interact with callable procedure statements, nor do I understand what  would cause the qryrtndta field to be set to FALSE, but I think that my changes don't materially affect those cases, and the new code should have generally the same behaviors in those cases as the old code.\r\n\r\nI'm doing some final testing, and should post my patch shortly.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2005-11-27T01:02:13.000+0000","updated":"2005-11-27T01:02:13.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317791/comment/12358559","id":"12358559","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Here's my proposed patch.

Pendleton","active":true},"body":"After re-reading the changes and stepping through the code again, I believe that the patch is correct, and the removal of the finalizeChain() call from splitQRYDTA is proper. Here is my reasoning:\r\n\r\nThe previous flow-of-control for a split QRYDTA block was that writeFDODTA assembled a large row, which splitQRYDTA then split across multiple QRYDTA blocks, sending each of those blocks and waiting for the next CNTQRY message before continuing. By the time that splitQRYDTA returned, any QRYDTA blocks containing partial portions of that large row had been sent to the client, and the current QRYDTA block was filled with the final bytes of the split row. The finalizeChain call in splitQRYDTA was necessary because that was how the partial QRYDTA blocks were sent to the client.\r\n\r\nIn the new flow-of-control, splitQRYDTA does not actually send the QRYDTA block to the client, nor does it wait for the CNTQRY from the client. Instead, all sending and receiving happens in the \"normal\" location in processCommands. splitQRYDTA arranges to split the data, records the partial data in the result set, and control \"pops\" all the way back out to processCommands. The QRYDTA block which contains the partial row data is sent by the finalizeChain() call in processCommands, at line 897.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, in both old and new code, externalized data was sent after the QRYDTA containing the last remainder bytes of the split row, by calling writeEXTDTA from writeQRYDTA.\r\n\r\nThus the old code had two finalizeChain calls, because a QRYDTA block might be sent either by processCommands, or by splitQRYDTA, depending on whether it contained a split row or not. The new code has only one finalizeChain call, because all QRYDTA blocks are sent by processCommands.\r\n\r\nOne case that I had trouble exercising in my testing is that there is *also* a call to splitQRYDTA from doneData, and perhaps in that case there is a problem? Fundamentally, I think the flow of control will be the same: doneData calls splitQRYDTA to prepare the partial block, control pops back out to processCommands to send the response and wait for the CNTQRY, then processLeftoverQRYDTA will drop the remainder bytes into a subsequent QRYDTA to be sent. Still, I have not been able to provoke such a case in my simple testing.\r\n\r\nAre there flaws in my reasoning here? Additional test cases I should try?\r\n\r\nDo you know of a test case which will cause splitQRYDTA to be called from doneData? \r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2005-12-13T03:00:10.000+0000","updated":"2005-12-13T03:00:10.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317791/comment/12360509","id":"12360509","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Marking as closed since Kathey has committed the patch to the trunk and I've verified that it addresses my problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2005-12-16T01:17:55.000+0000","updated":"2005-12-16T01:17:55.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317791/comment/12366650","id":"12366650","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"body":"Reopening this bug to submit a patch to reset splitQRYDTA variable in DRDAResultSet.close().

Attached is d614_a.diff, which contains the patch that Deepa found as well as a new regression test which demonstrates the problem. To verify this fix, run the regression test without the patch and you will get a StringOutOfBoundsException in the client-side parsing, then apply the one-line change to DRDAResultSet.java and the test will pass. To run the test by itself:\r\n\r\n  java -Dframework=DerbyNetClient org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunTest derbynet/prepStmt.java\r\n\r\nThank you very much to Deepa for finding the problem and describing it so clearly. For everybody else, here's the quick summary:\r\n\r\n  DRDAStatement objects on the server side can get re-used after they have been closed.\r\n  After a statement has been closed, the client may re-use the Section Number when\r\n  sending a new request for a new statement. The server then discovers that there was\r\n  a statement object in memory, and it automatically closes that statement and re-uses\r\n  it. With my first patch to this bug, I introduced a problem in this processing; the\r\n  splitQRYDTA field was not cleared when the statement was closed. This meant that\r\n  if that splitQRYDTA field just happened to have some pending query data from the\r\n  previous statement at the point where it was re-used, the pending query data would\r\n  erroneously stick around and be returned as the first result for the new statement.\r\n\r\n  Thus, the conditions that lead up to this bug are:\r\n  - a statement is created, and results are fetched, and a QRYDTA block has to be split.\r\n  - instead of sending a CNTQRY to fetch the split data, the client instead closes the\r\n    statement.\r\n - then, the client creates a new statement with the same Section Number (it is free to\r\n   do so, since the previous statement has been closed), and sends a new query\r\n   request over.\r\n - at that point, the server responds to the new query with the leftover split QRYDATA.\r\n\r\nThe regression test simply forces the server down this code path.\r\n\r\nIf somebody could please take a look at this patch, I would be very grateful.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"created":"2006-02-17T03:35:01.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-17T03:35:01.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12317791/comment/12366751","id":"12366751","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bryanpendleton","name":"bryanpendleton","emailAddress":"bpendleton dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true},"body":"Updated patch d614_a_with_close_stmts.diff addresses feedback from Dan and Deepa: the test should close the statement objects at the end in order to avoid wasting client driver resources and to match standard JDBC style.
