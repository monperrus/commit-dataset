The file that implements the test is called JDBC40TranslationTest.java. The test harness uses the last part of the name to decide how it should run the test.

If it ends with \".junit\", the harness knows it's a java class which can be run by a JUnit test runner.\r\n\r\n2) JDBC20Translation and JDBC30Translation are located in both org.apache.derby.iapi.reference and org.apache.derby.shared.common.reference (the former used by the embedded driver and the latter by the client driver). Since constants in an interface are compiled in by the compiler, these interfaces need not be and are not part of the released jar files. The previous version of JDBC40Translation was only located in org.apache.derby.shared.common.reference, and for consistency (and because I needed the constants in the embedded driver) I created a copy in org.apache.derby.iapi.reference. Instead of making a copy of the interface, I let it the new interface extend the original one. This is also done by JDBC30Translation, and because of the way the compiler handles constants in interfaces, there is no run-time dependency between the two interfaces (actually, none of them exist at run-time).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-07-05T01:49:31.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-05T01:49:31.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12344221/comment/12419689","id":"12419689","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Hi Bryan, did you have more comments to the patch?
