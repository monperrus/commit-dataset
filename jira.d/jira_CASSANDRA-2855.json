That functionality existed before in core Cassandra but was removed because of the performance penalty of that checking.  However with Hadoop support in the RecordReader, that is batch oriented anyway, so individual row reading performance isn't as much of an issue.  Also we would make it an optional config parameter for each job anyway, so people wouldn't have to incur that penalty if they are confident that there won't be those empty rows or they don't
