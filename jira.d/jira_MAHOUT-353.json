The cache should never be unable to load the column vector, since it should have generated a column vector for all. This is the underlying issue.\r\n\r\nActually... my implementation of Retriever in RecommenderMapper is wrong. It should never return null. It should treat this situation as an error and throw an exception, which would be clearer. I should really change it to do that.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't solve the problem, but it makes it clearer where the problem is:\r\n\r\nI think there is perhaps some issue in MapFilesMap? If I had to guess, this is where the issue is. It should be reading from all the intermediate map files that an earlier stage outputs to find column vectors. The fact that it's not finding them suggests that's where the issue is.\r\n\r\nI don't have your data or your setup so have some difficulty debugging from here. If you are in a position to look into the code, can you examine whether MapFilesMap seems to find all of those map files correctly, read them, etc.?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=srowen","name":"srowen","emailAddress":"srowen at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=srowen&avatarId=10104"},"displayName":"Sean Owen","active":true},"created":"2010-03-31T10:58:44.056+0000","updated":"2010-03-31T10:58:44.056+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12460701/comment/12851828","id":"12851828","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=huiwenhan","name":"huiwenhan","emailAddress":"huiwen dot han at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Han Hui Wen ","active":true},"body":"there has one situation:\r\n\r\nsome user only has one item,\r\nso in UserVectorToCooccurrenceMapper class\r\nthere is no output for this item ,\r\n\r\nso can not Retrieve the similar item for this item in RecommenderMapper.\r\n\r\nam I　right?
