(It makes sense, too.)\r\n\r\nHowever this has a side effect: \r\n  For queries that became \"empty\" as result of filtering (stopping), QueryParser would now return null. \r\n\r\nThis is an API semantics change, because applications that used to get a BooleanQuery with 0 clauses as parse result, would now get a null query. \r\n\r\nHere is a closer look on the behavior change:\r\n\r\nOriginal behavior:\r\n   (1)  parse(\" \")  == ParseException\r\n   (2)  parse(\"( )\")  == ParseException\r\n   (3)  parse(\"stop\") == \" \"    \r\n        (actually a boolean query with 0 clauses)\r\n   (4)  parse(\"(stop)\")  == \" \"    \r\n        (actually a boolean query with 0 clauses)\r\n   (5)  parse(\"a stop b\") == \"a b\"\r\n   (6)  parse(\"a (stop) b\") == \"a () b\"   \r\n        (middle part is a boolean query with 0 clauses)\r\n   (7)  parse(\"a ((stop)) b\") == \"a () b\" \r\n        (again middle part is a boolean query with 0 clauses)\r\n\r\nModified behavior:   \r\n   (3)  parse(\"stop\") == null\r\n   (4)  parse(\"(stop)\")  == null    \r\n   (6)  parse(\"a (stop) b\") == \"a b\"   \r\n   (7)  parse(\"a ((stop)) b\") == \"a b\" \r\n\r\nI think the modified behavior is the right one - applications can test a query for being null and realize that it is a no-op. \r\n\r\nHowever backwards compatibility is important - would this change break existing applications with annoying new NPEs?\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, QueryParser parse() methods can be modified to return a phony empty BQ instead of returning null, for the sake of backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doronc","name":"doronc","emailAddress":"cdoronc at gmail dot
