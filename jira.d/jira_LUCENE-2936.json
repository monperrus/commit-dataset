In my opinion, norm values of zero should not necessarily decode to a floating point value of zero (we might want to adjust our norm decoder by default to not do this). \r\n\r\nOtherwise, in addition to your problem, the search degrades into a pure boolean ranking model (as TF and IDF are completely zeroed out).\r\n\r\nThis is really unlikely with the default relevance ranking (unless you use a boost of zero or similar), but is possible e.g. if you use a different SmallFloat quantization. I raised this issue on LUCENE-1360 where if you were to use this \"short field\" quantization on a large document, what should we do?\r\n\r\nSo in my opinion, we should consider adjusting the NORM_TABLE in Similarity so that if the norm happens to be zero, it does not decode to a float of zero. This will have no impact on performance as its a statically calculated table.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rcmuir","name":"rcmuir","emailAddress":"rcmuir at gmail dot

It did show up in the \"testMultiFieldBQofPQ*\" methods i added because BooleanQuery's explain logic was actually modifying the score of it's explanation based on the match value of the explanation for the sub-queries (because of coord)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2011-02-25T00:38:13.911+0000","updated":"2011-02-25T00:38:13.911+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12499436/comment/13013320","id":"13013320","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"body":"Bulk close for 3.1","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsingers","name":"gsingers","emailAddress":"gsingers at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Grant Ingersoll","active":true},"created":"2011-03-30T15:49:58.415+0000","updated":"2011-03-30T15:49:58.415+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-2936/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i04nif:"}}
