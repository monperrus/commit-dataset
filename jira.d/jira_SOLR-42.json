Commonly it looks like this:\r\n\r\n...valid html...<?xml:namespace prefix = o />...valid html...\r\n\r\nNotice the PI starts with \"<?xml\" but terminates with a close tag., doh.\r\n\r\nThis issue is manifested in HTMLStripReader. It causes the following code to read too much off the buffer and invalidates the previous mark at the beginning of the tag.\r\n\r\nprivate int readProcessingInstruction() throws IOException {\r\n    // \"<?\" has already been read\r\n    while ((numRead - lastMark) < readAheadLimitMinus1) {\r\n      int ch = next();\r\n      if (ch=='?' && peek()=='>') {\r\n        next();\r\n        return MATCH;\r\n      } else if (ch==-1) {\r\n        return MISMATCH;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    return MISMATCH;\r\n  }\r\n\r\nThe demoralizing part is the special treatment (readAheadLimitMinus1) isn't enough.  There is actually a \"over read\" by 2 chars.\r\n\r\nThe IOException - Invalid Mark happens when readProcessingInstruction() retuns (a mismatch because the entire buffer is read without finding the close PI) and restoreState(); is called to reset the marks - which fails.\r\n\r\nIf I tweak readAheadLimitMinus1 like this\r\n\r\nreadAheadLimitMinus1 -= 2 \r\n\r\nSo maybe the variable should be readAheadLimitMinus3 ;)\r\n\r\nthen the buffer limits are preserved and the exception isn't found, parsing proceedes as expected.\r\n\r\nJim  \r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=imjimmurphy","name":"imjimmurphy","emailAddress":"jim dot murphy at pobox dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jim Murphy","active":true},"created":"2008-08-26T19:41:08.150+0000","updated":"2008-08-26T19:41:08.150+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12346872/comment/12628473","id":"12628473","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=goksron","name":"goksron","emailAddress":"goksron at yahoo dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lance Norskog","active":true},"body":"A slight nit: Unicode contains three characters, fffD, fffE, and fffF, which are not supposed to appear in any document.
