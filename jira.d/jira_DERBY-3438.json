Because the statement is never prepared, it will never be inserted into the cached, nor (incorrectly) fetched from the cache in the first step.\n\nOf course, one could also explicitly check for null in either the Logical(Prepared|Callable)Statement[40], StatementKeyFactory or StatementCacheInteractor.\nHowever, the proposed change is small, isolated to one class and makes the exceptional case be
