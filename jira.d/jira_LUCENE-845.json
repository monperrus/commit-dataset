We clearly need to keep the current \"by doc\" merge policy\r\neasily available for this use case.\r\n\r\n> If that is right, what does that say about making by-segment-size the default? It's gonna break (as in bad results) people relying on that behavior that don't change their code. Is there a community consensus on this? It's not really an API change that would cause a compile/class-load failure, but in some ways, it's worse ...\r\n\r\nI think there are actually two questions here:\r\n\r\n  1) What exactly makes for a good default merge policy?\r\n\r\n     I think the merge policy we have today has some limitations:\r\n\r\n       - It's not resilient to \"normal\" usage of the public APIs in\r\n         IndexWriter.  If you call flush() yourself, if you change\r\n         maxBufferedDocs (and maybe mergeFactor?) partway through an\r\n         index, etc, you can cause disastrous amounts of over-merging\r\n         (that's this issue).\r\n\r\n \t I think the default policy should be entirely resilient to\r\n\t any usage of the public IndexWriter APIs.\r\n\r\n       - Default merge policy should strive to minimize net cost\r\n         (amortized over time) of merging, but the current one\r\n         doesn't:\r\n\r\n         - When docs differ in size (frequently the case) it will be\r\n           too costly in CPU/IO consumption because small segments are\r\n           merged with large ones.\r\n\r\n         - It does too much work in advance (too much \"pay it\r\n           forward\").  I don't think a merge policy should\r\n           \"inadvertently optimize\" (I opened LUCENE-854 to describe\r\n           this).\r\n\r\n       - It blocks LUCENE-843 (flushing by RAM usage).\r\n\r\n         I think Lucene \"out of the box\" should give you good indexing\r\n         performance.  You should not have to do extra tuning to get\r\n         substantially better performance.  The best way to get that\r\n         is to \"flush by RAM\" (with LUCENE-843).  But current merge\r\n         policy prevents this (due to this issue).\r\n\r\n  2) Can we change the default merge policy?\r\n\r\n     I sure hope so, given the issues above.\r\n\r\n     I think the majority of Lucene users do the simple \"create a\r\n     writer, add/delete docs, close writer, while reader(s) use the\r\n     same index\" type of usage and so would benefit by the gained\r\n     performance of LUCENE-843 and LUCENE-854.\r\n\r\n     I think (but may be wrong!) it's a minority who use\r\n     ParallelReader and therefore have a reliance on the specific\r\n     merge policy we use today?\r\n\r\nIdeally we first commit the \"decouple merge policy from IndexWriter\"\r\n(LUCENE-847), then we would make a new merge policy that resolves this\r\nissue and LUCENE-854, and make it the default policy.  I think this\r\npolicy would look at size (in bytes) of each segment (perhaps\r\nproportionally reducing # bytes according to pending deletes against\r\nthat segment), and would merge any adjacent segments (not just\r\nrightmost ones) that are \"the most similar\" in size.  I think it would\r\nmerge N (configurable) at a time and at no time would inadvertently\r\noptimize.\r\n\r\nThis would mean users of ParallelReader on upgrading to this would\r\nneed to change their merge policy to the legacy \"merge by doc count\"\r\npolicy.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2007-05-02T09:58:39.364+0000","updated":"2007-05-02T09:58:39.364+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12365610/comment/12520120","id":"12520120","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"\r\nFirst cut patch.

EG, if you set maxBufferedDocs to 1000 but then flush after\r\nevery added doc, and you add 1000 docs, with the current merge policy,\r\nevery 10 flushes you will merge all segments together.  Ie, first\r\nsegment has 10 docs, then 20, 30, 40, 50, ..., 1000.  This is where\r\nO(N^2) cost on merging comes from.

So merge\r\ncost will be much less (not O(N^2)), but, you will have more max segments\r\nin the index (up to 1 + (mergeFactor-1) * log_mergeFactor(numDocs)),\r\nor 28 segments in this example (I think).\r\n\r\nBasically the new merge policy tries to make levels \"all the way\r\ndown\" rather than forcefully stopping when the levels get smaller than\r\nmaxBufferedDocs, to avoid the O(N^2) merge cost.\r\n\r\n> One solution to this would be in cases like this to merge the small\r\n> segments to one but not include the big segments.

Because that \"small segment\" will have to\r\ngrow bit by bit up to 1000 (causing the O(N^2) cost).\r\n\r\nNote that the goal here is to be able to switch to flushing by RAM\r\nbuffer size instead of docCount (and also merge by byte-size of\r\nsegments not doc count), by default, in IndexWriter.  But, even once\r\nwe do that, if you always flush tiny segments the new merge policy\r\nwill still build levels \"all the way down\".\r\n\r\nHere's an idea: maybe we can accept the O(N^2) merge cost, when the\r\nsegments are \"small\"?  Ie, maybe doing 100 sub-optimal merges (in the\r\nexample above) does not amount to that much actual cost in practice.\r\n(After all nobody has complained about this :).\r\n\r\nI will run some tests.  Clearly at some point the O(N^2) cost will\r\ndominate your indexing time, but maybe we can set a \"rough\" docCount\r\nbelow which all segments are counted as a single level and not take\r\ntoo much of a indexing performance hit.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2007-08-16T18:28:27.282+0000","updated":"2007-08-16T18:28:27.282+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12365610/comment/12520334","id":"12520334","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"You may avoid the cost of a bunch of small merges, but then you pay the price in searching performance.

This effectively \"truncates\" what would otherwise be a\r\nlong tail of segment sizes, when you are flushing many tiny segments\r\ninto your index.\r\n\r\nIn order to pick reasonable defaults for the min segment size, I ran\r\nsome benchmarks to measure the indexing cost of truncating the tail.\r\n\r\nI processed Wiki content into ~4 KB plain text documents and then\r\nindexed the first 10,000 docs using this alg:\r\n\r\n  analyzer=org.apache.lucene.analysis.SimpleAnalyzer\r\n  doc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.LineDocMaker\r\n  directory=FSDirectory\r\n  docs.file=/lucene/wiki4K.txt\r\n  max.buffered = 500\r\n\r\n  ResetSystemErase\r\n  CreateIndex\r\n  {AddDoc >: 10000\r\n  CloseIndex\r\n\r\n  RepSumByName\r\n\r\nI'm using the SerialMergeScheduler.\r\n\r\nI modified contrib/benchmark to always flush a new segment after each\r\nadded document: this simulates the \"worst case\" of tiny segments, ie,\r\nlowest latency indexing where every added doc must then be visible to\r\nsearchers.\r\n\r\nEach time is best of 2 runs.
