Some of this is normal.  But if an indexed shape has any of its leaf detail levels \"simplified\" (removed) up to a higher level, then a false-positive match can occur that is a little too eager when one of those cells that were simplified-away don't intersect the query shape, and thus shouldn't be considered a match for this predicate. \r\n\r\nMarking as \"Minor\" because it should be quite rare, and when it does occur, the answer (a match) will usually appear close-enough due to the grid approximation that it's not a totally inaccurate answer.
