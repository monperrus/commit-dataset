Note: The \"exitVM.*\" permission is automatically granted to all code loaded from the application class path, thus enabling applications to terminate themselves. Also, the \"exitVM\" permission is equivalent to \"exitVM.*\".'\r\nSo this appears to me that exiting is always possible from classes that are inside the application ClassLoader (passed via -classpath to JVM). We could only forbid it, if Solr would load ZooKeeper in a separate ClassLoader. I have to try this out.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is that policy files only allow \"grants\" not \"deny\", so if you grant RuntimePermission.* (as it is currently) you cannot explicitely forbid it for one code part. You have to do it vice versa: Disallow it for all (by having the long list of RuntimePermissions instead of \"*\") and only allow it for one classloader.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-09-03T12:30:34.481+0000","updated":"2012-09-03T12:30:34.481+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605983/comment/13447280","id":"13447280","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"body":"bq.

Stack traces are retrieved from all over the place in the test framework too (on test timeouts, on thread leaks). Will it work?\r\n\r\nIf you install a SecurityManager that does not allow this, it will of course not work. The thing here is more special and has nothing to do with Test-Framework: If the Security Manager itsself has to do additional checks that may be denied, it must du this using his own security context (thats what AccessController is doing here) and not with the one of the caller.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2012-09-04T06:36:30.913+0000","updated":"2012-09-04T06:36:30.913+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605983/comment/13447513","id":"13447513","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"body":"Ok, I get it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dweiss","name":"dweiss","emailAddress":"dawid dot weiss at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dawid Weiss","active":true},"created":"2012-09-04T06:44:00.431+0000","updated":"2012-09-04T06:44:00.431+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605983/comment/13447515","id":"13447515","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"For the test-framework an example for using AccessControler.doPrivileged() would be:\r\n- Policy denies e.g. file access outside the test runner J0 working dir (which may be a good idea) -> \"untrusted code\"\r\n- But Policy allows writing files outside the J0 working directory for the test-framework.jar file itself -> \"trusted code\"\r\n\r\nThe problem here would be: \r\n- \"untrusted\" code calls \"trusted\" code, e.g. the test (\"untrusted\") calls a method from test-framework that writes outside base directory. The calling \"untrusted\" code is not allowed to do this, but the test-framework itsself (\"trusted\") is allowed to do this.\r\n- SecurityManager would disallow this, but that may not what we want.\r\n\r\nThe naming of AccessController.doPrivileged is a little bit misleading. It does not mean something is \"privileged\", it just tells that the closure should not be handled by access checks of the code calling you, but with the context of your own code.
