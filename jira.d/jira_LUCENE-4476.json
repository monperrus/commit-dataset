Does this also happen on windows if you sign artifacts with your GPG key?\r\n\r\nDefinitely not! The password is hidden! This is clearly a cygwin issue (and only if you use the cygwin console window). With the official Windows 7 cmd.exe in the official Windows console window the password is not shown. I never use cygwin for builfding on windows, why do you Steven? To run ANT and build artifacts a plain cmd.exe is fine.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI agree, Uwe - password hiding with Ant's secure input handler works on Win7 cmd window for me too.  Definitely a cygwin-specific issue.\r\n\r\nI use bash under an Xterm, because I feel like it :) - it's the maximally Unix-ish experience on Windows.  Also, when mixing native binaries and Cygwin binaries, it's easier to use Cygwin tools to keep everybody happy from bash.exe, rather than from cmd.exe.  Also, the Xterm window is resizeable (win console has a fixed width) and is more customizable.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nAh, also: if you run bash.exe in the official Windows console windows (not cygwin's own), it also works. It's a bug of the dumb cygwin-internal console window only (why do they have it?) - sorry, I have to rant about Cygwin; I use it, too, but only to execute find/sed/grep...\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n(And perl, and python, and .....)\r\n\r\nInteresting, I hadn't considered running bash under the windows console.  Of course C:\\cygwin\\bin\\ would have to be on the path.\r\n\r\nI agree the cygwin-internal console window is sucky - I never use it.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2012-10-22T12:21:16.314+0000","updated":"2012-10-22T12:21:16.314+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12611312/comment/13485158","id":"13485158","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"body":"I committed Robert's patch:\r\n\r\n- trunk: [r1402630|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1402630&view=rev]\r\n- branch_4x: [r1402637|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1402637&view=rev]","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_rowe","name":"steve_rowe","emailAddress":"sarowe at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Rowe","active":true},"created":"2012-10-26T20:03:17.773+0000","updated":"2012-10-26T20:03:17.773+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12611312/comment/13610629","id":"13610629","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=commit-tag-bot","name":"commit-tag-bot","emailAddress":"root-jira-commit_tag_bot at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176"},"displayName":"Commit Tag Bot","active":true},"body":"[branch_4x commit] Steven Rowe\r\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1402637\r\n\r\nLUCENE-4476: stage-maven-artifacts: prompt for credentials by default, rather than reading from settings.xml; and stop requiring (grand-)parent POMs' presence in the maven local repository\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=commit-tag-bot","name":"commit-tag-bot","emailAddress":"root-jira-commit_tag_bot at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=commit-tag-bot&avatarId=16176"},"displayName":"Commit Tag Bot","active":true},"created":"2013-03-22T16:22:37.929+0000","updated":"2013-03-22T16:22:37.929+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LUCENE-4476/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i089n3:"}}
