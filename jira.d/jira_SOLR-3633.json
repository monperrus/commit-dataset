\"/solr/null/admin/system?wt=json\" and then complain that the admin handler can't be found -- the logic should be something like:\r\n\r\n* can we talk to CoreAdminHandler at all? if not give a specific error\r\n* if CoreAdminHandler says there are no cores, give a message to that effect \r\n** offer the info/commands that are stil available (ie: \"Core Admin\" functionality)\r\n** perhaps suggesting that if they expected to cores to already exist, they should check logs 9allthough this may not be needed depending on how far we get with \"#2\" below)\r\n* if cores are available, then try to use /corename/admin to get the other info to populate the UI, and if we can't find it *then* mention that they need to add config\r\n** i would also suggest using the \"defaultcore\" if

/admin/system.\r\n\r\nUn fortunatley, the result is still that the admin UI is virtually useless -- my hope was to at least have the \"Add Core\" button working, but the way/place the core admin buttons are generated is down deep in code for binding to loading the page for a specific core -- which in this patch never gets called since there are no cores.\r\n\r\nI've reached the limit of how much i understand this stuff ... maybe someone will find this patch useful and be able to keep going along these lines so that the CoreAdmin stuff at least works, and then the other tabs will start to

Either new users such as myself need some way to add a core back through the web UI, and/or the web UI should continue working even when there are zero active cores.
