It was an exception from network server  closing   the connections after Derby was intentionally shut down,  similar to DERBY-273.   I was not able to reproduce the failure after many dozens of runs of the test and repeating derbyAll.  Looking at the test   I see that Derby is intentionally shut  down and so the exception is not unexpected but the shutdown is not passed through properties, so I am assuming that this was a rare intermittent diff and not caused by this change.  \r\n\r\nProbably still to be resolved is what  Network Server should do with exceptions that occur before Derby is started or after Derby is shut down.  Right now it prints them to the console or System.out if the console is not specified. It seems like it could at least print them to derby.log if only the database and not the engine was shut down.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2005-09-15T22:08:47.000+0000","updated":"2005-09-15T22:08:47.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12313700/comment/12329598","id":"12329598","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"Committed to trunk (2892227) and 10.1 (289672)\r\n\r\nDate: Fri Sep 16 15:59:43 2005\r\nNew Revision: 289672\r\nURL: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=289672&view=rev\r\nLog:\r\nDERBY-530\r\n\r\nClientDriver ignores Properties object in connect(String url, Properties connectionProperties) method\r\nMerge from trunk\r\nsvn merge -r289226:289227 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2005-09-17T08:07:25.000+0000","updated":"2005-09-17T08:07:25.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12313700/comment/12329600","id":"12329600","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"body":"The sending of user/password in RDBNAM is fixed by DERBY-530.  getURL still needs to be fixed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kmarsden","name":"kmarsden","emailAddress":"kmarsdenderby at sbcglobal dot net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kathey Marsden","active":true},"created":"2005-09-17T08:12:33.000+0000","updated":"2005-09-17T08:12:33.000+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-530/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i078ev:"}}
