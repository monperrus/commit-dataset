responses I see that not only wordbreak, but also directSpellchecker \r\ndoes not return some results in distributed mode. \r\nThe request handler I was using had \r\n\r\n<str name=\"group\">true</str>\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I desided to turn of grouping and I see spellcheck results in distributed \r\nmode.\r\n\r\n\r\ncurl 'server1:8983/solr/test/testhandler?q=paulusoles&indent=true&rows=10&shards.qt=testhandler'\r\nhas no spellchek results \r\nbut\r\n\r\ncurl 'server1:8983/solr/test/testhandler?q=paulusoles&indent=true&rows=10&shards.qt=testhandler\r\n&group=false'\r\nreturns results.\r\n\r\nSo, the conclusion is that grouping causes the distributed spellcheker to fail.\r\n\r\nCould please you point me to the class that may be responsible to this issue?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nAlex.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdyer","name":"jdyer","emailAddress":"james dot dyer at ingrambook dot
