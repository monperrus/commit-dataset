In the default case, this is the schema corresponding to the user id.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the copy of the SQL standard I have says in sec. 5.4, 4a that the unqualified identifiers should resolve to the current schema for the SQL session and the definition of routine invocation has no language to contradict that and simply says that it's a qualified identifier. While it seems logical to me that an unqualified function name in a check constraint would resolve to the schema containing the table with the constraint, it could be useful to have the function resolve to different functions in each schema, e.g. allowing different users to insert data into a table with different constraints.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"created":"2008-11-11T23:26:27.275+0000","updated":"2008-11-11T23:26:27.275+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408289/comment/12646906","id":"12646906","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Thanks, Andrew.
