I suggest not using bold, but\r\n  plain text with a succeeding colon, instead.\r\n- Since the behavior is now the same for both client and embedded, I\r\n  do not think it is necessary to dwell with previous differences.\r\n  That would make things a bit simpler.  E.g., instead of mentioning\r\n  that the change is only for short lobs, you can just say that it now\r\n  holds for all Lobs.  That way, I think you do not really need to\r\n  write separate statements for client and embedded.\r\n- For the 'Application Changes Required' section, you can refer to the\r\n  release note for the locator-based implementation (DERBY-208) for a\r\n  discussion on the effects of changing the transaction life span.\r\n- For the first paragraph, I think it is sufficient to say:\r\n      \"A Blob or Clob object is no longer valid after the termination\r\n      (commit or rollback) of the transaction it were created in.\"\r\n  Since transaction cannot live beyond a connection this should cover\r\n  that case, but I guess it does not harm to state that explicitly.  I\r\n  do not think it is necessary to discuss implicit or explicit\r\n  commits/rollbacks here.\r\n  \r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=oysteing","name":"oysteing","emailAddress":"oystein dot grovlen at sun dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Øystein Grøvlen","active":true},"created":"2007-06-15T12:17:21.237+0000","updated":"2007-06-15T12:17:21.237+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12370514/comment/12505199","id":"12505199","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=anurag","name":"anurag","emailAddress":"anurag dot shekhar at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Anurag Shekhar","active":true},"body":"thanks Øystein for the review.
