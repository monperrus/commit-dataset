That is the \"envelope\" supplied by MS.packit().  We need to adhere to the first 8 bytes of that format forever.  Once we know the version, we have a lot of flexibility, meaning that the wire format for o.a.c.net.Message can change whenever we need it to.\r\n\r\nbq. it only restricts gossip, which isn't A Big Deal since it's so little traffic.\r\nThere are two problems with this.  First, it locks us down to the serialization outlined in MessageSerializer (to include HeaderSerializer).  That removes a lot of flexibility if we are ever interested in changing those formats.  Second, it introduces two code paths by special casing gossip messages.\r\n\r\nbq. so how about this? we try to parse gossip packets in the current version; if that fails, we parse in the old version\r\nThat wouldn't work if a N node was trying to join a cluster of N-1 nodes.  (The N-1 nodes can't speak a protocol from the future.)\r\n\r\nWhat if, when communication starts up, messages are sent in the current format and the previous format until for format of the destination is known (after a response is received)?  Kind of a hack, but it avoids bouncing, locking serialization formats and special casing gossip messages.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gdusbabek","name":"gdusbabek","emailAddress":"gdusbabek at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gdusbabek&avatarId=10070"},"displayName":"Gary Dusbabek","active":true},"created":"2011-01-12T01:27:14.138+0000","updated":"2011-01-12T01:27:14.138+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12495313/comment/12980491","id":"12980491","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"body":"bq.
