I don't really like this, as it could be some unusual MergePolicy out there sometimes wants to do such merging.\r\n\r\nSo I think a better solution, but API breaking to the MergePolicy, which is OK because it's @experimental, is to change the segmentsToOptimize argument; currently it's just a set recording which segments need to be optimized away.  I think we should change it to a Map<String,Boolean>, where the Boolean indicates whether this segment had been created by a merge in the current optimize session.  Then I'll fix our MPs to not cascade in such a case.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2011-06-14T10:33:25.744+0000","updated":"2011-06-14T10:33:25.744+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12510128/comment/13049254","id":"13049254","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"body":"is the possibility of a never ending optimize in this situation (never ending deletes) really something we need to \"fix\" ?\r\n\r\ni mean ... isn't this what hte user should expect?  they've asked for a single segment w/o deletes, and then while we try to give it to them they keep deleting -- how is it bad that we optimize doesn't stop until it's completely done ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hossman","name":"hossman","emailAddress":"hossman_apachejira at fucit dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hossman&avatarId=21247"},"displayName":"Hoss Man","active":true},"created":"2011-06-14T16:21:44.524+0000","updated":"2011-06-14T16:21:44.524+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12510128/comment/13049298","id":"13049298","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yseeley%40gmail.com","name":"yseeley@gmail.com","emailAddress":"yseeley at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yonik Seeley","active":true},"body":"Regardless of if one views this as a bug or not, I think the more useful semantics are to at least \"merge all of the current segments into 1 and remove all *currently* deleted docs\" (i.e. I agree with Mike).
