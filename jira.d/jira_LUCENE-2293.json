This means,\r\nif more than 5 threads enter IndexWriter at once, they will \"share\"\r\nonly 5 thread states, meaning we gate CPU concurrency to 5 running\r\nthreads inside IW (each thread must first wait for the last thread to\r\nfinish using the thread state before grabbing it).\r\n\r\nThis is bad because modern hardware can make use of more than 5\r\nthreads.  So I think an immediate fix is to make this settable\r\n(expert), and increase the default (8?).\r\n\r\nIt's tricky, though, because the more thread states, the less RAM\r\nefficiency you have, meaning the worse indexing throughput.  So you\r\nshouldn't up and set this to 50: you'll be flushing too often.\r\n\r\nBut... I think a better fix is to re-think how threads write state\r\ninto DocumentsWriter.  Today, a single docID stream is assigned across\r\nthreads (eg one thread gets docID=0, next one docID=1, etc.), and each\r\nthread writes to a private RAM buffer (living in the thread state),\r\nand then on flush we do a merge sort.  The merge sort is inefficient\r\n(does not currently use a PQ)... and, wasteful because we must\r\nre-decode every posting byte.\r\n\r\nI think we could change this, so that threads write to private RAM\r\nbuffers, with a private docID stream, but then instead of merging on\r\nflush, we directly flush each thread as its own segment (and, allocate\r\nprivate docIDs to each thread).  We can then leave merging to CMS\r\nwhich can already run merges in the BG without blocking ongoing\r\nindexing (unlike the merge we do in flush, today).\r\n\r\nThis would also allow us to separately flush thread states.  Ie, we\r\nneed not flush all thread states at once -- we can flush one when it\r\ngets too big, and then let the others keep running.  This should be a\r\ngood concurrency gain since is uses IO & CPU resources \"throughout\"\r\nindexing instead of \"big burst of CPU only\" then \"big burst of IO\r\nonly\" that we have today (flush today \"stops the world\").\r\n\r\nOne downside I can think of is... docIDs would now be \"less\r\nmonotonic\", meaning if N threads are indexing, you'll roughly get\r\nin-time-order assignment of docIDs.  But with this change, all of one\r\nthread state would get 0..N docIDs, the next thread state'd get\r\nN+1...M docIDs, etc.  However, a single thread would still get\r\nmonotonic assignment of docIDs.\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12310120":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10121","value":"New","id":"10121"}],"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"25750","summary":"IndexWriter has hard limit on max concurrency","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":43,"total":43,"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12458038/comment/12840911","id":"12840911","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelbusch","name":"michaelbusch","emailAddress":"buschmic at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Busch","active":true},"body":"Good timing - a couple days ago I was thinking about how threading could be changed in the indexer.\r\n\r\nThe other downside is that you would have to buffer deleted docs and queries separately for each thread state, because you have to keep the private docID?

The IndexWriter (or a new class) would have the doc queue, basically a load balancer, that multiple DocumentsWriter instances would pull from as soon as they are done inverting the previous document?\r\n\r\nToday, DW enforces thread binding - the same thread will always receive the same ThreadState. This allows applications who distribute the documents between threads based on some criteria, to get a locality of Documents indexed by each thread. I can't think of why an application would rely on that, but still that's something that happens.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the pull approach, Lucene would introduce another place where it allocates threads. Not only would we need to allow setting that concurrency level, we'd also need to allow overriding how a thread is instantiated. That will change the way applications are written today - I assume lots of applications that are multi-threaded rely on the multiple threads to index the documents. But now those threads won't do anything besides register a document in a queue. Therefore such applications will need to move to single-threaded indexing (because multi-threaded gives them nothing), and control the threads IW allocates.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer to leave multi-threaded indexing to the application. If it anyway contains a queue of incoming documents (from the outside) and allocates threads to process them in parallel (for example to parse rich text documents, fetch content from remote machines etc.), we wouldn't want them to do all this just to waste those threads at the end and let IW control another level of concurrency.\r\n\r\nAnother downside of such approach is that it breaks backward compatibility in a new way we've never considered. If the application allocates threads from a pool, and we introduce a new IW/DW w/ concurrency level=3 (for example), then the application will suddenly spawn more threads that it intended to. Perhaps it chose to use SMS, or overrode CMS to handle the threads allocation, but it's definitely not ready to handle another thread allocator.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that the queue cannot be of just Document objects, but a DocAndOp objects to account for add/delete/updates ... another complication.\r\n\r\nMy preference is to keep the queue to the application.\r\n\r\nbq. The other downside is that you would have to buffer deleted docs and queries separately for each thread state\r\n\r\nJust for clarity - you'll need to do it with the queue approach as well, right? I mean, a DW which pulled an operation from the queue, which is a DELETE op, will need to cache that DELETE so that it will be executed on all documents that were indexed up until flush. So that does not save anything vs. if we change DW to flush by ThreadState.\r\n\r\nInstead, I prefer to take advantage of the application's concurrency level in the following way:\r\n* Each thread will continue to write documents to a ThreadState. We'll allow changing the MAX_LEVEL, so if an app wants to get more concurrency, it can.\r\n** MAX_LEVEL will set the number of ThreadState objects available.\r\n* All threads will obtain memory buffers from a pull which will be limited by IW's RAM limit.\r\n* When a thread finishes indexing a document and realizes the pool has been exhausted, it flushes its ThreadState.\r\n** At that moment, that ThreadState is pulled out of the 'active' list and is flushed.

Yes, I think each DW will have to record its own buffered delete Term/Query, mapping to its docID at the time the delete arrived. \r\n\r\nI think in the future deletes in DW could work like this:\r\n- DW keeps of course track of a private sequence id, which gets incremented in the add, delete, update calls\r\n- a DW has a getReader() call, the reader can search the ram buffer\r\n- when DW.gerReader() gets called, then the new reader remembers the current seqID at the time it was opened - let's call it RAMReader.seqID; if such a reader gets reopened, simply its seqID gets updated.\r\n- we keep an growing int array with the size of DW's maxDoc, which replaces the usual deletes bitset\r\n- when DW.updateDocument() or .deleteDocument() needs to delete a doc we do that right away, before inverting the new doc. We can do that by running a query using a RAMReader to find all docs that must be deleted. Instead of flipping a bit in a bitset, for each hit we now keep track of when it was deleted:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n// init each slot in deletes array with -1\r\nstatic final int NOT_DELETED = Integer.MAX_INT;\r\n...\r\nArrays.fill(deletes, NOT_DELETED);\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\npublic void deleteDocument(Query q) {\r\n  reopen RAMReader\r\n  run query q using RAMReader\r\n  for each hit {\r\n    int hitDocId = ...\r\n    if (deletes[hitDocId] == NOT_DELETED) {\r\n      deletes[hitDocId] = DW.seqID;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n...\r\n  DW.seqID++;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNow no matter of how often you (re)open RAMReaders, they can share the deletes array. No cloning like with the BitSet approach would be necessary:\r\n\r\nWhen the RAMReader iterates posting lists it's as simple as this to treat deletes docs correctly. Instead of doing this in RAMTermDocs.next():\r\n{code}\r\n  if (deletedDocsBitSet.get(doc)) {\r\n    skip this doc\r\n }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nwe can now do:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n  if (deletes[doc] < ramReader.seqID) {\r\n    skip this doc\r\n  }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n1. Add 3 docs with DW.addDocument() \r\n2. User opens ramReader_a\r\n3. Delete doc 1\r\n4. User opens ramReader_b\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 1: DW.seqID = 2; deletes[]={MAX_INT, MAX_INT, MAX_INT}\r\nAfter 2: ramReader_a.seqID = 2\r\nAfter 3: DW.seqID = 3; deletes[]={MAX_INT, 2, MAX_INT}\r\nAfter 3: ramReader_b.seqID = 3\r\n\r\nNote that both ramReader_a and ramReader_b share the same deletes[] array. Now when ramReader_a is used to read posting lists, it will not treat doc 1 as deleted, because (deletes[1] < ramReader_a.seqID) = (2 < 2) = false; But ramReader_b will see it as deleted, because (deletes[1] < ramReader_b.seqID) = (2 < 3) = true.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this approach for the future when we have a searchable DW buffer?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelbusch","name":"michaelbusch","emailAddress":"buschmic at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Busch","active":true},"created":"2010-03-04T17:47:35.247+0000","updated":"2010-03-04T17:47:35.247+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12458038/comment/12841463","id":"12841463","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shaie","name":"shaie","emailAddress":"serera at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shai Erera","active":true},"body":"What about the following scenario:\r\n# A document is added w/ term A to DW1\r\n# A document is added w/ term A to DW2 (by another thread)\r\n# A deleteDocuments(Term-A) is issued against DW1 (could be even 3, where A does not exist)\r\n\r\nI thought that when (3) happens, the delete-by-term needs to be issued against all DWs, so that later when they apply their deletes they'll *remember* to do so.

Allows you to efficiently share a single int[] for deletions across many reopened RAM segment readers. \r\n\r\nHow will we handle flushing?

It's similar in spirit to LUCENE-1313, but that issue is still flushing segments (but, into an intermediate RAMDir).\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI agree! Thinking further about this: Each (re)opened RAM segment reader needs to also remember the maxDoc of the corresponding DW at the time it was (re)opened. This way we can prevent a RAM reader to read postinglists beyond that maxDoc, even if the writer thread keeps building the lists in parallel. This allows us to guarantee the point-in-time requirements.\r\n\r\nAlso, the PostingList objects we store in the TermHash already contain a lastDocID (if I remember correctly). So when a RAM reader termEnum iterates the dictionary it can skip all terms where term.lastDocID > RAMReader.maxDoc.\r\n\r\nIt's quite neat that all we have to do in reopen then is to update ramReader.maxDoc and ramReader.seqID.\r\n\r\nOf course one big thing is still missing: keeping the term dictionary sorted. In order to implement the full IndexReader interface, specifically TermEnum, it's necessary to give each RAM reader a point-in-time sorted dictionary. At least in one direction, as a TermEnum only seeks forward.\r\n\r\nI think we have two options here: Either we try to keep the dictionary always sorted, whenever a term is added. I guess then we'd have to implement a b-tree or something similar?\r\n\r\nThe second option I can think of is to add a \"nextTerm\" pointer to TermHash.Postinglist. This allows us to build up a linked list across all terms. When a ramReader is opened we would sort all terms, but not by changing their position in the hash - instead by building the single-linked list in sorted order.\r\n\r\nWhen a new reader gets (re)opened we need to mergesort the new terms into the linked list. I guess it's easy to get this implemented lock-free. E.g. if you have the linked list a->c, and you want to add b in the middle, you set b->c before changing a->c. Then it's undefined if an in-flight older reader would see term b. The old reader must not return b, since b was added after the old reader was (re)opened. So either case is fine: either it doesn't see b cause the link wasn't updated yet, or it sees it but doesn't return it, because b.lastDocID>ramReader.maxDoc.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that we will have to pay the price of sorting in reader.reopen, which however should be cheap if readers are reopened frequently. Not sure though if this linkedlist approach is more or less compelling than something like a btree?\r\n\r\nBtw: Shall we open a new \"searchable DW buffer\" issue or continue using this issue for these discussions?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelbusch","name":"michaelbusch","emailAddress":"buschmic at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Busch","active":true},"created":"2010-03-05T16:30:06.035+0000","updated":"2010-03-05T16:30:06.035+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12458038/comment/12841923","id":"12841923","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelbusch","name":"michaelbusch","emailAddress":"buschmic at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Busch","active":true},"body":"bq.
