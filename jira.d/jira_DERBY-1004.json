To match the method names to the actions, I think it would be good to have all changes to the physicalConnection in one method, something like resetPhysicalConnection.

This method calls closeWithoutRecyclingToPool(), which throws an exception if there are transactions in progress.  I can't get rid of this check because in some cases (e.g. when close() is called), this is a valid exception.\r\n\r\nAfter calling createLogicalConnection(), ClientPooledConnection.getConnection() calls reset on the physical connection.  Through a series of twisty passages this ends up calling Connection.resetPhysicalConnection(), and then at the network layer everything is cleaned up without actually closing the socket, and then calls Connection.completeReset(), which then calls a method completeLocalRollback() (I just discovered this), which appears to do a client-side-only rollback and closes any open cursors.\r\n\r\nI suppose another way to solve this would be, in ClientPooledConnection.getConnectio() to call physicalConnection_.reset() *first*, and then createLogicalConnection(), and at that point the transactions would all be rolled back (accomplished by completeReset()).  But changing the order to me seems somewhat risky, I am not sure I fully comprehend the client semantics and am worried I\"d potentially introduce strange regressions.\r\n\r\nIf you think this might actually be reasonable, I can go ahead and try this.  I'll probably try it while I'm waiting to hear back from you :)\r\n\r\nDavid","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davidvc","name":"davidvc","emailAddress":"david at vancouvering dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Van Couvering","active":true},"created":"2006-06-09T00:50:56.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-09T00:50:56.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12329141/comment/12415409","id":"12415409","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"body":"Hi David, My comment was only based on your previous comment which made me wonder why you did not add the rollback to resetConnection itself.
