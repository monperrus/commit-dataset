For instance, the constructors for the underlying VTIs could raise an error if the current user wasn't the DBO. This could be implemented for the 10.8.2 maintenance release and could be backported to older branches. However, it would not be possible to grant other users SELECT privilege on statement_cache and transaction_table and it would not be possible to grant other users EXECUTE privilege on error_log_reader() and statement_duration().\r\n\r\n2) Involved but flexible -- In this approach, we would re-model these vtis as table functions. The error_log_reader and statement_duration vtis would be re-modelled as table functions and statement_cache and transaction_table would be remodelled as views on table functions. Corresponding metadata tuples would be stuffed into SYSALIASES, SYSVIEWS, and SYSTABLEPERMS. This would let the DBO grant EXECUTE privilege on the table functions. However, the metadata changes would mean that we could not implement this solution in a maintenance release like 10.8.2. and we could not backport the fix to older branches.\r\n\r\nI am leaning toward an incremental, hybrid approach: implement (1) in the 10.8.2 timeframe, close this issue, and create a new issue for the work on (2). I would be happy to do (1). We could consider implementing (2) if users clamor for it.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"created":"2011-08-29T18:58:49.188+0000","updated":"2011-08-29T18:58:49.188+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12520580/comment/13094023","id":"13094023","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rhillegas","name":"rhillegas","emailAddress":"rhillegas at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Hillegas","active":true},"body":"Attaching derby-5395-01-ac-protectVTIs.diff.
