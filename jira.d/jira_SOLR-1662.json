AB_AAB_Stream.process() duplicates the token by just putting it uncloned into the outQueue. As the consumer of the BufferedTokenStream assumes that the Token is private it is allowed to change it - and by that it also changes the token in the outQueue. If you e.g. put another TokenFilter in fromt of this AB_AAB_Stream, and modify the token there it would break.\r\nIn my opinion, the responsibility to clone is in AB_AAB_Stream, BufferedTokenStream will never return the same token twice by itsself.
