Since Eclipse 3.1 has been GA since the end of June the Derby plug-ins should work with the current release of Eclipse.\r\n\r\nNote that with this patch there is no support to run the Derby plug-ins on Eclipse 3.1M5 or less.\r\n\r\nWithout applying this patch when any of the functionality of the Derby UI plug-in is invoked like starting the\r\nNetwork Server, running ij, running sysinfo the following pop-up box appears (this example is for the Network Server):\r\n\r\n\"Error starting Derby Network Server :\r\n  Plugin org.apache.derby.ui was unable to load class\r\n  org.apache.derby.ui.launch.StartDerbyServerLaunchConfigurationDelegate\".\r\n\r\n2) Update the version of the UI and Doc plugins to be 1.1.0 instead of 1.0.0.\r\n      Since I'd like for these plug-ins to be released as zip files with the 10.1 release of Derby, and the 10.1 Derby core plug-in, \r\n      I updated the version of the plug-ins to be 1.1, to make it more obvious the 1.1 UI plug-in is compatible with the 10.1 Core plug-in.\r\n\r\nOutput from svn stat:\r\n\r\nM
