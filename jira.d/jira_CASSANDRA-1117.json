RowIndexReader.getPosition for instance, is 110 lines long. The MMAP logic for finding segment boundaries is implemented twice in trunk: once for the index, and once for the data file. Additionally, the segment support is not abstracted enough to support using MMAP'd reads for calls to getNearestPosition, which always fall back to buffered files.\r\n\r\nThis patchset addresses all of these issues, and sets us up to be able to use MMAP'd reads for Scanners (which currently always use buffered files). Also, the set adds support for iterating over the segments in a file, which getNearestPosition punts on entirely, and getPosition special cases. Finally, because the segmenting is extracted from RowIndexedReader, it will be much easier to reuse for the new API in 998 and the new file format for 674.
