You will want to increase the Memtable threshold and object sizes when doing Binary Memtable import, which also would most likely yield increasing the heap size. But once done, you will not want to have these thresholds that high at all times. So since you are decreasing the heap, this makes sense. This might cause a little difficulty with op situations but we will be providing a way to change these thresholds/sizes using either nodeprobe or another utility.
