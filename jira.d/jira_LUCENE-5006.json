Willnauer","active":true},"body":"here is a first/rough cut with some nocommits but it shows the idea. This patch removes all dependencies to DocumentsWriter and IndexWriter from DWPT. I factored everything out and made DWPT basically a non-reuseable class. It initializes itself entirely in the ctor including the segment name etc. \r\n\r\nAt the same time DWPTThreadPool doesn't initialize DWPT anymore it only handles ThreadStates and pooling and the actual DWPT creation is done on the ThreadPools consumer level. This makes the pool much simpler as well. \r\n\r\nDocumentsWriter doesn't communicate with the IW directly. It only creates certain events that will be processed by the IW once the DW action is done. This works since all the Events are kind of atomic operations which can be executed once we exit DW. For instance if we flush a segment the DW doesn't push it up to the IW but once DW returns IW proceses the event an pulls the new flushed segment in. The same is true for pending merges etc.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the locking a lot here since we basically can't deadlock anymore from DW or DWPT since we don't even have a reference to IW anymore. The only remaining thing is when we create a new DWPT we need to call into IW to get a new seg. name but it's a start.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"created":"2013-06-14T20:18:41.465+0000","updated":"2013-06-14T20:18:41.465+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12648167/comment/13684150","id":"13684150","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Thanks Simon.\r\n\r\nIt looks like most of the changes are 1) the new Events system for DW\r\nto communicate back to IW when something needs to happen (flush,\r\napplyDeletes, etc.) so that DW never needs to call back into a sync'd\r\nIW method, and 2) passing IW as an argument to various methods instead\r\nof holding it as a member in DW?

I changed _maybeMerge_ to _hasEvents_ consistently.\r\n\r\nThe changes in DWPT and DWPTThreadPool are mainly due to the fact that I move the creation of DWPT into DW and out of the ThreadPool. The ThreadPool only maintains the ThreadState instances but is not responsible for creating the actual DWPT. DWPT is now not \"reuseable\" anymore, yet we never really reused them but if they were initialized and we did a full flush we kept using them with a new DeleteQueue which is gone now. This is nice since DWPT is now solely initialized in its Ctor. This includes the segment name which we obtain from IW when the DWPT is created. This remains the only place where we sync on IW which is done in updateDocument right now. \r\n\r\nI think this patch is a step into the right direction making this simpler, at the end of the day I'd want to change the lifetime of a DW to be a single flush and replace the entire DW once we flush or reopen. This would make a lot of logic much simpler but I don't want to make this big change at once so maybe we should work to get the current patch into trunk and let it bake in a bit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"created":"2013-06-19T08:24:44.822+0000","updated":"2013-06-19T08:24:44.822+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12648167/comment/13688159","id":"13688159","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"+1, thanks Simon!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2013-06-19T17:04:15.253+0000","updated":"2013-06-19T17:04:15.253+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12648167/comment/13690215","id":"13690215","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=simonw","name":"simonw","emailAddress":"simonw at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Simon Willnauer","active":true},"body":"mike since I am going on vacation and I am not very keen to watch our builds failing with sneaky concurrency problems I created a branch CI build from my github repo to stress this a bit while I am on vacation... http://builds.flonkings.com/job/DWPT_Refactoring/ one I come back I can get this in...
