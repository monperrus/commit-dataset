The new masters are needed to account for the differences in JCC 2.8 which allows getBytes on character types and does not default to IBMJCE driver for encryption. With this patch, I ran derbynetmats with JCC2.8 driver with Sun jdk 1.4. I also ran the four changed tests using JCC2.8 with IBM jdk1.4 and Sun jdk 1.5.\r\n\r\nThis patch only adds new masters. I would appreciate if someone can take a look at it and commit if okay.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2006-05-05T07:36:25.000+0000","updated":"2006-05-05T07:36:25.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12333199/comment/12377931","id":"12377931","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"body":"Committed to trunk with revision 399909.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fuzzylogic","name":"fuzzylogic","emailAddress":"mcintyre dot a at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew McIntyre","active":true},"created":"2006-05-05T08:14:39.000+0000","updated":"2006-05-05T08:14:39.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12333199/comment/12415901","id":"12415901","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"body":"Verified tests pass with JCC 2.8 (46)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepa","name":"deepa","emailAddress":"dremesh at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepa Remesh","active":true},"created":"2006-06-13T02:21:52.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-13T02:21:52.000+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-1290/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i06yov:"}}
