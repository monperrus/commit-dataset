It is the caller's duty to create a priority queue with a sensible size, and it's not BooleanQuery's fault that other classes are using its getMaxClauseCount() wrongly. Moreover, changing PriorityQueue or BooleanQuery in the way Doron did, might potentially have side-effects because they are used in many places in Lucene. How do we know that nowhere in Lucene will we ever need a priority queue with a million elements?\r\n\r\nTherefore I suggest a different patch, changing only FuzzyQuery. \r\n\r\nhe idea in the patch I'm attaching is that while FuzzyQuery *is allowed to* create BooleanQuery.getMaxClauseCount() clauses, it doesn't have to do so, and doesn't need to create a priority queue of that size when this number is huge. I added to FuzzyQuery its own maxClauseCount (with per-instance getter/setter methods)  and FuzzyQuery will never try to create more than this number of clauses, even if Boolean.getMaxClauseCount() is huge.\r\n\r\nI set FuzzyQuery's default maxClauseCount to 1024, for backward compatibility (this is what happens today when you use BooleanQuery's defaults). However, it is likely that a user will want to set this number much lower than that. In fact, the whole idea of the priority queue is that it may be enough to take only a small number the most similar terms, so setting a FuzzyQuery's maxClauseCount to 100 or even 10 makes sense to me. This new feature is an added benefit of my patch.\r\n\r\nMy patch also includes Javadoc changes describing the new feature, and a new test case that failed before the fix, and succeeds after this patch.

It currently does not limit the PQ's number of entries, it just only consumes maxClauseCount ones.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass, but they are no real test of the PQ behaviour, as the current test cases do not test more terms than maxClauseCount. So the tests pass in all cases, independent how the compareTo method looks like, so the ordering is not important because the queue never gets full. I will add a test.\r\n\r\nI will also try to implement the max size, but for now, the patch shows, how the code could look like with j.u.PQ.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2009-11-04T17:11:22.152+0000","updated":"2009-11-04T17:11:22.152+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12329613/comment/12773652","id":"12773652","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"body":"Here a patch, that fixes FuzzyQuery. It uses j.u.PQ and has a small optimization to not add ScoreTerms, that would never be seen in the first maxClauseCount terms (tracking a bottom value).\r\n\r\nIt also adds an testcase, where the maxClauseCount is lowerd downto 2 and the FuzzyQuery would hit 3 terms, so one too much. This tests the algorithm to not add this entry to the PQ.\r\n\r\nNadav: The solution you propsed for limiting the number of entries in the PQ does not work, as poll() removes the head element of the queue, not the bottom that falls out. There is no way to remove the bottom value in Java's PQ easily. So we should j.u.PQ only for this issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","emailAddress":"uwe at thetaphi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true},"created":"2009-11-04T21:48:18.022+0000","updated":"2009-11-04T21:48:18.022+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12329613/comment/12773807","id":"12773807","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nyh","name":"nyh","emailAddress":"nyh at il dot ibm dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nadav Har'El","active":true},"body":"Uwe, you are right, I got confused...
