Once we've cached the norms, we never use that\r\nIndexInput again (as far as I can tell?).  This is also nice because\r\nit frees up file handles once norms are cached.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n  * Fixed TestMultiSearcher: it was closing a searcher and then\r\n    continuing to use it.\r\n\r\n  * Added unit test case showing this bug before the patch.\r\n\r\n  * Improved MockRAMDirectory to \"act like Windows\" by refusing to\r\n    delete or overwrite an open file.  I removed \"final\" from 2\r\n    methods (deleteFile, openInput) of RAMDirectory for this.\r\n\r\n  * Changed SegmentReader.getNorms to close the Norms after
