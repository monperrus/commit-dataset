For larger search string \r\nthe other method position (Clob, Clob) should be used but only if the \r\nClob implementation support Clob of larger than INTEGER.MAX_VALUE.\r\n\r\nReusing the reader will be a great optimization but it's not possible \r\nunless we modify the UTF8Reader to support mark and reset. 256 I \r\nselected because the existing code was using it but changing it to \r\nsomething larger is not a problem.Increasing the buffer size will \r\nimprove the performance when the Writer needs to be resettled  back  \r\nprevious read blocks. In other case it will add little value as the \r\nWriter itself does a caching and reads in block from the underlying \r\nstream and returns only the chars which it has in memory, subsequent \r\nread will make it fetch another full block in memory.\r\n\r\nThere are good number of tests related to position in BlobClob4BlobTest \r\nbut some how they couldn't expose this bug. I suggest you to wait for \r\nthe new implementation of clob before you add new tests as it will be \r\nnicer to know the implementation before writing the test so you can \r\nwrite test which exercises the path which is ignored by the current tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=anurag","name":"anurag","emailAddress":"anurag dot shekhar at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Anurag Shekhar","active":true},"created":"2007-03-23T11:01:32.982+0000","updated":"2007-03-23T11:01:32.982+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364911/comment/12483522","id":"12483522","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=anurag","name":"anurag","emailAddress":"anurag dot shekhar at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Anurag Shekhar","active":true},"body":"sorry for the typo its Reader everywhere in the above comment not Writer.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=anurag","name":"anurag","emailAddress":"anurag dot shekhar at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Anurag Shekhar","active":true},"created":"2007-03-23T11:07:16.277+0000","updated":"2007-03-23T11:07:16.277+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364911/comment/12484042","id":"12484042","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Committed 'derby-2250.diff' (the name a bit confusing, as it refers to a different Jira issue, but it is the correct patch) to trunk with revision 522440.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"created":"2007-03-26T06:50:55.466+0000","updated":"2007-03-26T06:50:55.466+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364911/comment/12484057","id":"12484057","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kristwaa","name":"kristwaa","emailAddress":"kristwaa at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kristwaa&avatarId=14736"},"displayName":"Kristian Waagan","active":true},"body":"Attached 'derby-2450-javadoc.diff' which rewrites/-formats the JavaDoc.\r\nI kept the algorithm documentation in the JavaDoc, since it is only generated as part of the engine documentation.
