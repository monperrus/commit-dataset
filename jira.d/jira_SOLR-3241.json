nothing more!\r\n\r\nThe polyField case is different: its too late in DocumentBuilder to do anything here after the creation of IndexableFields: moreover we cannot nuke the whole boost for the field because we cannot assume anything just because isPolyField() == true, for example a custom field type might not even be instanceof AbstractSubTypeField! \r\n\r\nBecause of this I think these fieldtypes should really treat the fact they use 'real fields' as an impl detail. so I added the logic to their subfield
