If you really want to start a network server from the command line inside the test, you could have a look at derbynet/testconnection.java. However, I don't think that would improve the test very much.\r\n\r\nOne minor comment: The code that you uncommented says \"Cloudscape\" many times. Maybe it should be changed to Derby?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2006-07-13T19:29:08.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-13T19:29:08.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12332984/comment/12420881","id":"12420881","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fernanda","name":"fernanda","emailAddress":"fernanda dot pizzorno dot derby at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Fernanda Pizzorno","active":true},"body":"I saw that the code I uncommented said \"Cloudscape\" and I thought of replacing it by \"Derby\", but then I saw that \"Cloudscape\" was much more used in that file (NetworkServerControlImpl.java) so I did not change it.
