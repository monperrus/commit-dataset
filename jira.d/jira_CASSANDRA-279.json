I also didn't know about ProcessBuilder -- learn something every day. :)\r\n\r\nsome minor changes.  sorry for the long-ish list, most are really quick ones:\r\n\r\n- use fooPath for strings that represent fs paths.  so you'd have String snapshotPath and File snapshotDir.  less confusing than Dir/Directory.\r\n\r\n- you aren't modifying the sstables_ map so you only need to take a read lock, even though you're writing to disk\r\n\r\n- prefer File.separator to System.getProperty(\"file.separator\").  prefer new File(parent, child) to parent + separator + child when a File is needed.\r\n\r\n- throw new IOException(\"Snapshot directory must be set.\"); -- let's just force this to be set at config time rather than throw an error during the snapshot process that we can't propagate up to the user easily.  if we also mkdir it at config time that is one less check we need to do, too.\r\n\r\n- snapshotDirectory, snapshotDir, currentSnapshotDir, snapshotTagDirectory -- can we cut down on the local vars here at all?  would it help to point out FileUtils.createDirectory which can create multiple subdirs at once, as necessary?\r\n\r\n+       if (clientSuppliedName != null && !clientSuppliedName.equals(\"\")) {^M\r\n+           currentSnapshotDir = snapshotDirectory + System.getProperty(\"file.separator\") + System.currentTimeMillis(\r\n+       }^M\r\n+       else^M\r\n+       {^M\r\n+           currentSnapshotDir = snapshotDirectory + System.getProperty(\"file.separator\") + System.currentTimeMillis(\r\n+       }^M\r\n\r\nhere it's better to build the common part of the var, then use one iff to add the tag if necessary.  this emphasizes the important part of the If and makes it easier to discern what the conditional is for.\r\n\r\n- normally you can use braces or not in one-liners as you please but for isDebugEnabled, always leave them off; it's too much noise for a debug statment\r\n\r\n- remember to set your ide to indent w/ 4 spaces, not tabs\r\n\r\n- windows support?  \"On Microsoft Windows, hard links can be created using the mklink /H command on Windows NT 6.0 and later systems (such as Windows Vista), and in earlier systems (Windows 2000, XP) using fsutil hardlink create.\"  if it's a big deal we can leave this to someone who actually needs the feature but it seems that if you have Windows available to test on it's not hard.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2009-07-17T02:51:11.271+0000","updated":"2009-07-17T02:51:11.271+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12429646/comment/12732332","id":"12732332","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=euphoria","name":"euphoria","emailAddress":"michael dot greene at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Greene","active":true},"body":"I'm definitely going to need this to play nicely with Windows (if not support, then at least fail gracefully) and can test (or write before committed) the functionality if Sammy can't.\r\n\r\nWhat's the intended use of these snapshots?
