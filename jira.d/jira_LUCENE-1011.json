All tests pass and I think this is ready for\r\ncommit.  I'll wait a few days.\r\n\r\nWhat's always tricky about debugging this kind of issue is figuring\r\nout if it's a locking problem (two writers are incorrectly getting the\r\nwrite lock at the same time), or if it's a IO \"stale cache\" issue.\r\n\r\nTo help with this, I created some basic instrumentation to \"verify\"\r\nthat locking is functioning correctly:\r\n\r\n  * A new LockFactory called VerifyingLockFactory, which just wraps a\r\n    pre-existing LockFactory and every time a lock is obtained or\r\n    released, contacts the LockVerifyServer (over a socket) to verify\r\n    the lock is not held by another process.  If it is held by another\r\n    process, meaning the LockFactory is broken, an exception is\r\n    thrown.\r\n\r\n  * LockVerifyServer.java (main) which just runs forever, accepting &\r\n    verifying these socket connections.\r\n\r\n  * A standalone (main) LockStressTest.java, whose sole purpose is to\r\n    obtain/release a specified lock file, very frequently.  You run\r\n    this on multiple machines, pointing to the same lock file, to\r\n    verify your LockFactory is working correctly.\r\n\r\nUsing these additions, one can stress test their locking in their\r\nparticular environment to determine whether their LockFactory is\r\nworking properly.\r\n\r\nI plan on committing these three source files so that others can\r\ndiagnose locking issues using the Lucene core jar.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"created":"2007-09-30T11:08:30.581+0000","updated":"2007-09-30T11:08:30.581+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12379349/comment/12531308","id":"12531308","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikemccand","name":"mikemccand","emailAddress":"lucene at mikemccandless dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael McCandless","active":true},"body":"Using the lock verifier above, I discovered something shocking (to\r\nme): NativeFSLockFactory is in general NOT RELIABLE for locking over\r\nNFS, while SimpleFSLockFactory is reliable modulo the \"fails to delete\r\non exit/crash\" minor issue.\r\n\r\nThis is unexpected because the whole reason we originally created\r\nNativeFSLockFactory was to improve locking over \"challenging\"\r\nfilesystems like NFS.
