This happens as part of loading\r\nthe DB2 driver in the following code in RunList.shouldSkipTest:\r\n\r\n    if (framework.equals(\"DerbyNet\"))\r\n    {\r\n       // skip if the derbynet.jar is not in the Classpath\r\n       try {\r\n           Class.forName(\"org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl\");\r\n       } catch (ClassNotFoundException cnfe) {\r\n           driverNotFound = true;\r\n           result = true;\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       // skip if the IBM Universal JDBC Driver is not in the Classpath\r\n       // note that that driver loads some javax.naming.* classes which may not\r\n       // be present at runtime, and thus we need to catch a possible error too\r\n       try {\r\n           Class.forName(\"com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver\");\r\n       } catch (ClassNotFoundException cnfe) {\r\n           driverNotFound = true;\r\n           result = true;\r\n       } catch (NoClassDefFoundError err) {\r\n           driverNotFound = true;\r\n           result = true;\r\n       }\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n\r\nWhen the Class.forName(\"com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver\") is executed (and\r\nthe DB2 driver is actually in the class path) it seems to call some\r\nmethods that happens to be defined by any JDBC driver (see also the\r\ncomment in the code). The class loader seems to touch derby.jar to try\r\nto find these methods, and this makes the embedded driver to\r\n\"automagically\" be loaded. And loading the embedded driver also boots\r\nthe Derby engine. Unfortunately, at this time the derby.system.home\r\nproperty is not set. This leads to the following happening\r\nduring autoloading of the embedded Driver:\r\n\r\n  * The FileMonitor's home variable gets the value null based on reading derby.system.home.\r\n\r\nWhen the Nist tests start an hour later and request to a database to\r\nbe created, the initialization of the StorageFactory fails with the\r\nsecurity exception since it uses the FileMonitor's home variable\r\n(which is null) as the directory of where to create the\r\ndatabase. Without the security manager this would have succeeded, but\r\nwith the security manager, a security exception is raised when trying\r\nto get the canonical path from the file system when only having the\r\nname of the database directory (i.e. just having \"wombat\" instead of\r\n\"/export/....../wombat\").\r\n\r\nSo basically the Nist tests fail due to the embedded driver is loaded\r\nbefore derby.system.home is set to the value that it should have for\r\nthe tests, which again leads to the security exception when the VM\r\ntrying to get the canonical path name for the current directory.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=olav","name":"olav","emailAddress":"olav dot sandstaa at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Olav Sandstaa","active":true},"created":"2006-06-06T19:30:31.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-06T19:30:31.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343990/comment/12414952","id":"12414952","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=olav","name":"olav","emailAddress":"olav dot sandstaa at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Olav Sandstaa","active":true},"body":"An overview of some of the suggestions that has been proposed for\r\nfixing this issue:\r\n\r\n* Remove the support for autoloading of the embedded driver (Yes, Rick\r\n  and the JDBC4 expert group have already said no to this, but I still\r\n  think there are situations where automagic loading of the drivers is\r\n  a bad idea)\r\n\r\n* Change the test harness so that derby.system.home is set to a value\r\n  that is OK for all tests suites (running with useprocess=false)\r\n  early during initialization (before touching any JDBC driver code)\r\n\r\n* Change the RunSuite(?) code so that it unloads the embedded driver\r\n  and the engine as part of the start up (to get rid of the autoloaded\r\n  embedded driver)\r\n\r\n* Change the \"security manager\" properties for the Nist tests to avoid\r\n  the security exception when the VM tries to get the canonical path\r\n  for the working directory.\r\n\r\n* Split the loading of the embedded driver and booting the engine.\r\n  When the driver is (auto)-loaded only the driver is loaded.

Before a new test suite is started and the suite\r\nis defined to run as part of the same JVM (useprocess=false) the\r\nembedded driver and Derby engine is unloaded. The purpose of this is\r\nthat when the suite start running it will (re-)load an embedded driver\r\nthat will use the properties defined by the suite (in the case of the\r\nNist test the problem was that defined derby.system.home was not\r\nused). \r\n\r\nThe patch is ready for review and commit.
