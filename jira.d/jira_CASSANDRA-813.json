ParNew is pretty aggressive in my testing, spamming the logs with that isn't very useful.  But, people may experiment w/ different gc types (e.g. G1) so hardcoding this seems Bad.  But maybe we should let the first person who wants to experiment w/ G1 deal with that. :)\r\n\r\nsemi-related interesting thread from Voldemort on GC settings: http://groups.google.com/group/project-voldemort/browse_thread/thread/24230399a0d34dc8/d893fb5bcaf0d173?#d893fb5bcaf0d173","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jbellis&avatarId=18380"},"displayName":"Jonathan Ellis","active":true},"created":"2010-03-04T04:35:32.347+0000","updated":"2010-03-04T04:35:32.347+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12456880/comment/12841411","id":"12841411","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandon.williams","name":"brandon.williams","emailAddress":"driftx at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brandon.williams&avatarId=10054"},"displayName":"Brandon Williams","active":true},"body":"It seems to me the simplest thing to do is add a threshold for the minimum amount of time a GC must take before we log it.
