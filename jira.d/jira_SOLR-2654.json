So if you had a Solr instance up for a long time, and used replication, you could end up, over time, with a lot of open Directories in the directory cache - currently, this is not much of a problem - replication only works with FSDirectories anyway. But I'd like to see that limitation fixed too - so that something like a RAMDirectory could work with replication - and in that case, this would be slightly more important*, as an unclosed RAMDirectory will take up much more RAM than an FSDirectory, which does nothing on close anyway (*only slightly more important because replication only uses a new index dir in a minority of cases).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"created":"2011-08-07T21:18:03.056+0000","updated":"2011-08-07T21:18:03.056+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514137/comment/13080687","id":"13080687","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=markrmiller%40gmail.com","name":"markrmiller@gmail.com","emailAddress":"markrmiller at gmail dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=markrmiller%40gmail.com&avatarId=17267"},"displayName":"Mark Miller","active":true},"body":"So I removed the close directories hack for tests and realized that I need the solution I proposed above regardless - when we force open a new directory, we need to close the old one - because we replace it in the map (well, close it, or keep it around in another list/set).

We got Solr 3.5 running.\r\n\r\nOur configuration is:\r\n...\r\n<indexDefaults>\r\n ...\r\n <lockType>simple</lockType>\r\n</indexDefaults>\r\n\r\n<searchComponent name=\"spellcheck\" class=\"solr.SpellCheckComponent\">\r\n    <str name=\"queryAnalyzerFieldType\">textSpell</str>\r\n    <lst name=\"spellchecker\">\r\n      <str name=\"name\">default</str>\r\n      <str name=\"field\">_spell</str>\r\n      <str name=\"spellcheckIndexDir\">./spellchecker1</str>\r\n\t  <str name=\"buildOnCommit\">true</str> \r\n    </lst>\r\n...\r\n</searchComponent>\r\n\r\nThat results in:\r\n\r\nCaused by: org.apache.lucene.store.LockObtainFailedException: Lock obtain timed out: NativeFSLock@.../data/spellchecker1/write.lock\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.store.Lock.obtain(Lock.java:84)\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:1108)\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.spell.SpellChecker.setSpellIndex(SpellChecker.java:169)\r\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.spell.SpellChecker.<init>(SpellChecker.java:149)\r\n\tat org.apache.solr.spelling.AbstractLuceneSpellChecker.init(AbstractLuceneSpellChecker.java:127)\r\n\t... 22 more\r\n\r\nOur FS doesnt support native locking. That's why we configured locktype to simple. However, the Spellchecker code doesn't use this setting ... That can be read pretty easy from the code:\r\n\r\nSolr AbstractLuceneSpellChecker:\r\n  protected void initIndex() throws IOException {\r\n    if (indexDir != null) {\r\n      index = FSDirectory.open(new File(indexDir));\r\n    } else {\r\n      index = new RAMDirectory();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n=> doesnt give a locking factory so the default is used\r\n\r\nLucene FSDirectory:\r\n  protected FSDirectory(File path, LockFactory lockFactory) throws IOException {\r\n    // new ctors use always NativeFSLockFactory as default:\r\n    if (lockFactory == null) {\r\n      lockFactory = new NativeFSLockFactory();\r\n    }\r\n    directory = getCanonicalPath(path);\r\n\r\n    if (directory.exists() && !directory.isDirectory())\r\n      throw new NoSuchDirectoryException(\"file '\" + directory + \"' exists but is not a directory\");\r\n\r\n    setLockFactory(lockFactory);\r\n  }\r\n=> the default is NativeFSLock\r\n\r\nI think that makes the problem a little less theoretical and more severe then the read scenario","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkarallus","name":"rkarallus","emailAddress":"Ronny dot Karallus at t-systems-mms dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ronny Karallus","active":true},"created":"2012-06-21T21:25:55.052+0000","updated":"2012-06-21T21:28:50.671+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/SOLR-2654/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i03jgn:"}}
