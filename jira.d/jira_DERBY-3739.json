According to the javadoc for InputStream.skip(), the return value should be 0 in that case and no bytes should be skipped, but ArrayInputStream's implementation would decrease the position pointer and return the negative number. The attached patch fixes both the overflow and the problem with a negative argument. skipBytes() has the same problems, so I made it forward calls to skip() in order to fix the problem there as well.\r\n\r\nI didn't find any way to trigger the bug from user code since none of the streams that are returned to the users are built on top of ArrayInputStream, as far as I could see. Still, I think it should follow the contract of InputStream so that it doesn't give us any unpleasant surprises if we start using ArrayInputStream in other ways than we currently do. Since I couldn't find a way to test this through JDBC or SQL, I created ArrayInputStreamTest which tests the class directly.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that read(byte[],int,int) and readFully(byte[],int,int) have similar issues. Will fix those in a separate patch.\r\n\r\nsuites.All and derbyall ran cleanly with the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-06-30T10:13:52.025+0000","updated":"2008-06-30T10:13:52.025+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399173/comment/12609200","id":"12609200","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Updated summary to reflect that the issue doesn't only affect skip().","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-06-30T10:19:06.456+0000","updated":"2008-06-30T10:19:06.456+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399173/comment/12609496","id":"12609496","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 673026.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-07-01T08:54:17.026+0000","updated":"2008-07-01T08:54:17.026+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399173/comment/12610155","id":"12610155","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Here's a fix for read() and readFully(). I didn't add a test case, since it seems like the overflow only causes wrong results if the sum of the length of the stream and the length of the buffer we read into exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE, *and* the current position is near the end of the stream. Testing it requires a very big heap, in fact so big that we need a 64-bit JVM. I have tested it manually with the attached ReadOverflow.java (which throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException without the fix and successfully reads 32K of data with the fix). Although the overflow is unlikely to ever cause any problems, the fix is simple and doesn't add any extra complexity or extra computation, so I think it would be good to fix it anyway.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-07-03T08:11:29.349+0000","updated":"2008-07-03T08:11:29.349+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399173/comment/12610156","id":"12610156","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"body":"Committed revision 673610.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knutanders","name":"knutanders","emailAddress":"knut dot hatlen at oracle dot com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Knut Anders Hatlen","active":true},"created":"2008-07-03T08:14:44.835+0000","updated":"2008-07-03T08:14:44.835+0000"}]},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/DERBY-3739/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i072yn:"}}
