However this has never been guaranteed to be set to the number of mappers; it is how a caller sets a default number of mappers, which may be overridden by Hadoop, and which defaults to 1. \r\n\r\nI suspect that this may have actually been set, in some or all cases, to the number of mappers in Hadoop 1, but I am not sure. Certainly, sometimes it will happen to be set to a value that equals the number of mappers used.\r\n\r\nBut when it doesn't it causes the distribution of trees to mappers to be quite wrong. For example, with 20 trees and 8 mappers in one example, I find that mapred.map.tasks=1. Logging messages indicate that mapper 0 handles all trees (0-19), mapper 1 handles non-existent 20-39, etc.\r\n\r\nThe result is that most mappers do nothing and one does everything. This results in empty part-m-xxxxx files. And, that in turn fails the job. (This part I also suspect is new, or situation-specific, behavior in Hadoop 2. In any event, this code should never have idle mappers and fixing that avoids whatever is going on there.)\r\n\r\nThere's a second less serious issue in how trees are assigned to mappers. When the number of trees is not a multiple of the number of mappers, the remainer is assigned entirely to mapper 0. So with 20 trees and 8 mappers, all mappers build 2 trees, but mapper 0 builds 6. This is unnecessarily imbalanced.\r\n\r\nPatch coming once I can verify the fix, but current proposal is to:\r\n\r\n- Compute the number of maps ahead of time using TextInputFormat and set mapred.map.tasks\r\n- Fix the method that computes trees per mapper to spread as evenly as possible (i.e. all mappers build either N or N+1 trees)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"originalEstimate":"24h","remainingEstimate":"24h","originalEstimateSeconds":86400,"remainingEstimateSeconds":86400},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":86400,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"373750","summary":"Random
