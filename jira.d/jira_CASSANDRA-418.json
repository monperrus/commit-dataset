been compacted 3 times) so that you are never compacting sstables of consecutive generations -- all will have even numbers, or all odd.  something has broken that invariant.\r\n\r\nrather than try to band-aid the bucketizer i think making the generation-generator more robust is the way to go.  this seems like a flimsy property to try to preserve.\r\n\r\nmy vote would be to simplify: just pick the next monotonically increasing int any time we need a new tmp sstable file, whether for flush, compaction, or bootstrap.  I.e. via CFS.getTempSSTableFileName, without the extra increment.\r\n\r\nthe reason historically that FB tried to be fancy is, they were trying to optimize away reading older sstables at all if the data being queried was found in a newer one.  the \"only new sstables get a number from the atomic int, and the compactions fit in between\" was to preserve this.  (then you sort on the generation number and higher ones are always newer.)\r\n\r\nbut that can't work (see CASSANDRA-223) so we always do a full merge across all sstables now.  so we can simplify this safely.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbellis","name":"jbellis","emailAddress":"jbellis at gmail dot
