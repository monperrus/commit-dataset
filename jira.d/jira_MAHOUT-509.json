I verified TestClassifier and see that I missed out making these parameters optional. In the patch I had submitted, the default values of parameters were taken care of but changing the parameters to optional was missed out. I'll create a patch for this tonite and post it in here.\r\n\r\nFor 2 (trimming spaces), I believe this should be a common fix and not specific to TestClassifier. Any class that uses the property files and has an integer value will suffer from this issue. So I digged a little bit to see that the fix should be in MahoutDriver.  current code is {code} argMap.put(longArg, new String[] {mainProps.getProperty(key)}); {code} and should be changed to {code}argMap.put(longArg, new String[] {mainProps.getProperty(key).trim()}); {code}\r\nI believe this should be a separate Jira issue.
