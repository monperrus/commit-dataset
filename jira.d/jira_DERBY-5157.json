I'm a bit puzzled by the timeout exception, though. The transaction should be rolled back by BaseJDBCTestCase.tearDown() and release the locks, but for some reason rollback() fails with \"ERROR X0Y67: Cannot issue rollback in a nested connection when there is a pending operation in the parent connection.\" This isn't a problem introduced by the fix, so I'll go ahead committing the patch.
